- The [[Openâ€“closed principle | Open/Closed Principle]] (OCP) is one of the [[SOLID | SOLID principles]] of [[Object-oriented programming | object-oriented design]], which states that code should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing for the addition of new features without changing existing code and enhancing code extensibility and maintainability.
- The principle is violated when existing code is modified to add new functionality, as seen in the example of the PaymentProcessor class, which was initially designed to handle only credit card payments and was later modified to support [[PayPal]] payments, introducing potential bugs and affecting the stability of the existing codebase.
- To comply with the Open/Closed Principle, an abstraction, such as a protocol, can be used to create separate classes for each payment method, as demonstrated by the introduction of the PaymentProcessing protocol and the creation of specific classes, including CreditCardPaymentProcessor and PayPalPaymentProcessor, which conform to this protocol.
- By following the Open/Closed Principle, code becomes more extensible and modular, making it easier to add new functionality without the risk of introducing errors into the existing code, as new payment methods can be added by creating new classes that implement the PaymentProcessing protocol without modifying the existing code in the PaymentProcessor class.
- The Open/Closed Principle encourages a design approach that allows for the addition of new features and functionality without altering the existing code, thereby reducing the risk of introducing bugs and improving the overall maintainability of the codebase, as discussed by [[Ramdhas]] in the context of SOLID principles.
