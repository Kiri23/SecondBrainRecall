Multimedia framework

- FFmpeg is a [[Free and open-source software | free and open-source software]] project consisting of a suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other [[Multimedia | multimedia]] files and streams. At its core is the command-line ffmpeg tool itself, designed for processing video and audio files. It is widely used for format [[Transcoding | transcoding]], basic editing (trimming and [[Concatenation | concatenation]]), video scaling, video [[Post-production | post-production]] effects, and standards compliance ([[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers | SMPTE]], [[International Telecommunication Union | ITU]]).
- FFmpeg also includes other tools: ffplay, a simple media player, and ffprobe, a command-line tool to display media information. Among included libraries are [[Libavcodec | libavcodec]], an audio/video [[Codec | codec]] [[Library (computing) | library]] used by many commercial and free software products, libavformat (Lavf), an audio/video container mux and demux library, and libavfilter, a library for enhancing and editing filters through a GStreamer-like filtergraph.
- FFmpeg is part of the workflow of many other software projects, and its libraries are a core part of software media players such as [[VLC media player | VLC]], and has been included in core processing for [[YouTube]] and [[Bilibili]]. Encoders and decoders for many audio and video file formats are included, making it highly useful for the transcoding of common and uncommon media files.
- FFmpeg is published under the LGPL-2.1-or-later or GPL-2.0-or-later, depending on which options are enabled.
