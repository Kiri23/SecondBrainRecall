## Get Data into Recall [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImS-Ry44Uz8&t=47s)
You can input content into Recall in several ways, each creating a "Recall Summary Card" like the one you see now:

- **Pasting a URL**: Click “New” in the top-right corner of the Home page and paste the URL of any online content.
- **Mobile App**: Use the mobile app ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/recall-summarize-save/id6445893722)/[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recall.wiki)) to paste URLs or share content directly with the app.
- **Browser Extension**: Don't miss this step! Install and pin the Recall Browser Extension ([Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/recall-summarize-anything/ldbooahljamnocpaahaidnmlgfklbben)/[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/getrecall/)) to summarize any online content.
- **Additional Options**: Use the dropdown menu next to the "New" button to import bookmarks, upload PDFs or create a card from scratch.

## Customize the Recall Summary Card [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImS-Ry44Uz8&t=99s)
All your content in Recall is fully editable, including the option to add or change images.

- **Automatic Categorization**: Tags categorize content saved in Recall. Summary cards are automatically tagged based on the content's topic and existing tags are reused to ensure consistency in your [[Knowledge base | knowledge base]].
- **Customize Your Tags**: You can create new tags and nest them under existing ones using the "/" character. This can be done in the top left corner of a card or in the left panel's tag list. Easily drag and drop cards and tags to organize your knowledge base.
- **Entity Extraction**: Entities are keywords with high relevance, automatically extracted and converted into their own cards. These entities form the foundation of your [[Knowledge graph | knowledge graph]]. At the bottom of a summary card, entities are grouped with a number indicating how often they appear in your knowledge base. They are also referenced in the summary, where they can be clicked, expanded, and customized.
- **Create Your Own Entities and Links**:
    - Highlight text in your summary and click the lightning bolt to link it to an entity.
    - Type "/" in the card's body to create links to entities or other cards. For custom entities, select "create empty card."

## Review Content [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImS-Ry44Uz8&t=123s)
Most people will likely forget 90% of the content they consume within a week - this is just our natural forgetting curve. The Recall Review was built to offset this forgetting curve through reinforced understanding and retention.

- **Single Card Review**: Click 'Generate Questions' in the card menu (three dots in the top-right of the card) to create review questions.
- **Scheduled Review**: Cards with generated questions are added to a schedule using [[Spaced repetition | Spaced Repetition]] and [[Testing effect | Active Recall]] to resurface content tailored to your learning curve.

## Graph View [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImS-Ry44Uz8&t=146s)
The foundation of Recall is its [[Knowledge graph | knowledge graph]], where all extracted entities are interconnected. The Graph View visually represents this structure, offering a bird's-eye view of your [[Knowledge base | knowledge base]].

- **Single Card Exploration**: Click the graph icon on any card to see its connections.
- **Topic-Based Exploration**: Click “Graph” in the top left of the knowledge base and select a topic to filter your graph.
