## Love for programming [(00:00:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=42s)
- The experience of feeling joy and excitement in programming occurred during a college data structures class, specifically when learning about linked lists, which introduced the concept of infinite items and the ability to express huge ideas, and this moment had a profound impact [(00:00:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=47s).
- The teacher, Ray Babcock, was explaining linked lists and showed code with an abstract class node that had a private member of type node, which was a new and mind-expanding concept at the time, allowing for the creation of arbitrarily large systems [(00:01:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=69s).
- This experience was repeated in a software engineering class when learning about the decorator pattern, which allowed for the recursive construction of objects, and it further excited the idea that anything is possible in programming [(00:02:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=136s).
- The concept of a node in a linked list is symbolic and can be seen as a metaphor for humans, where each node only knows about its neighbor, just like humans only know about their local network, and this simplicity can be used to construct complex systems [(00:02:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=167s).
- The beauty of linked lists and recursion lies in their ability to create complex systems and solve problems in unique ways, and this realization can be profound and exciting for programmers, allowing them to create anything their mind can think of [(00:03:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=188s).
- The concept of recursion was also a powerful idea that took time to understand, but once grasped, it opened up new possibilities for problem-solving, and examples like the factorial function can help illustrate this concept, although it may take multiple experiences to fully appreciate its significance [(00:03:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=221s).
- The use of recursion and linked lists can also lead to challenges like memory leaks, but the beauty of these concepts lies in their ability to create complex systems and solve problems in unique ways, making them a fundamental part of programming [(00:03:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=199s).
- Programming experiences began with either [[Java (programming language) | Java]] or [[C++]], but the exact language is unclear, and it was later determined to be C++ [(00:04:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=264s).
- In college, software engineering classes focused on Java, but some students, referred to as the "cool kids," were using [[Lisp (programming language) | Lisp]], which was associated with AI and writing chess engines [(00:04:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=281s).
- The moment of falling in love with programming occurred while working with Lisp and writing programs, including chess engines, which could play against and beat the creator [(00:04:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=293s).
- Other programming experiences that brought joy included working with the game of life and cellular automata, which involved creating systems with simple rules that could evolve into complex behaviors [(00:05:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=313s).
- Early memories of programming are marked by an abundance of parentheses, particularly while working with Lisp [(00:06:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=362s).
- Initial programming experiences were in Java, which was used in a corporate-like environment, but the experience was rigid and unfulfilling [(00:06:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=370s).
- Struggling to understand recursion was a significant challenge, and despite using resources like the book "[[Dell Technologies | Dell]] and Dell learn [[Java (programming language) | Java]]," the concept remained elusive, leading to feelings of inadequacy [(00:06:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=406s).
- The struggle with recursion was exemplified by the inability to solve the tower of Hanoi problem, a classic recursive challenge, which remains unsolved to this day [(00:07:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=438s).
- The difficulty in understanding recursion stemmed from a lack of comprehension of its purpose and benefits, as it seemed like a complicated version of a for loop [(00:07:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=466s).
- A lab assignment that involved reading from a file and working with a 2D array helped to shift focus away from the struggles with recursion and towards more practical programming tasks [(00:08:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=483s).
- The process of understanding recursion involved finding a path through a maze, which led to the realization that creating a visited grid could help avoid revisiting the same places, and this understanding clicked into place when applying the concept to a specific problem [(00:08:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=496s).
- The initial understanding of recursion was hindered by measuring it against problems that were not well-suited to its application, such as list traversal, which is not a good use of recursion [(00:08:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=522s).
- Recursion requires a leap of faith and a different way of looking at the world, which can be powerful, and it was a great moment when this understanding was finally achieved [(00:09:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=543s).
- The first memory of understanding recursion was related to implementing a depth-first search for a game, which involved searching trajectories through the space of states recursively, and this was a mind-blowing experience [(00:09:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=582s).
- This understanding of recursion also coincided with the discovery of conspiracy theories, which was a separate but notable event [(00:10:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=606s).

## Hardest part of programming [(00:10:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=615s)
- The most painful aspect of programming is when there are no surprises or challenges, and everything is already known, making the work feel like a factory line task with no creativity, as experienced during a job at a company called Schedulicity [(00:10:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=616s).
- This experience was particularly difficult because it involved generating objects from a database, mapping them, and displaying them on a web page, with no unknowns or hurdles to overcome, making the work feel unenjoyable due to the lack of uncertainty and challenge [(00:11:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=672s).
- The absence of uncertainty and challenge was the most painful part of programming, as it made the work feel like it was just a matter of typing speed, with no need for problem-solving or creativity, and this experience was a profound realization about the nature of programming work [(00:12:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=723s).
- The company Schedulicity had a notable issue with its name, as it was often misspelled, and the company would optimize its [[Google]] ads to appear at the top of search results for various spellings of its name, which was seen as humorous [(00:10:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=649s).
- The experience at Schedulicity was one of two profound experiences of suffering in programming, and it highlighted the importance of challenge and uncertainty in making programming work enjoyable and engaging [(00:10:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=634s).

## Types of programming [(00:12:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=751s)
- The programming world is often viewed as just web programming, but in reality, there are many other areas, including embedded robotics, machine learning, networking, performance operating systems, compilers, and more, which are not as well-represented on social media platforms like [[Twitter]] [(00:12:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=753s).
- The majority of people may think that web programming is the most popular form of programming and that it contains the most amount of repositories on [[GitHub]], but this is not entirely accurate, as there are many other types of programming that are not as visible [(00:13:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=805s).
- Building one's own language can be a fun and rewarding experience for programmers, as it provides a unique perspective on how things work in life, and every programmer should try it at least once [(00:14:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=865s).
- The individual identifies as a tools engineer, having worked on various projects, including writing a UI library for the web that can behave like an [[IPad | iPad]], and building a JavaScript build system from scratch [(00:14:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=878s).
- Throughout their career, they have enjoyed building tools for developers to be successful, including working on libraries, build systems, and other projects that help developers do their jobs more efficiently [(00:15:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=931s).
- They spent 10 years at [[Netflix]], where they primarily worked on building things for developers to use, and they have always enjoyed this aspect of their work because their stakeholders and users understand programming and can provide valuable feedback [(00:15:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=933s).
- The difference between what people want and what they actually need is often a separation, as illustrated by [[The Henry Ford | the Henry Ford]] quote "I just want a faster horse," when in reality, people wanted a car, which is a completely different thing [(00:16:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=962s).
- Developers have a unique advantage in that they can work together with others to figure out what is needed and want, giving them a big picture view of programming in general [(00:16:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=974s).
- Starting at the interface and working backwards to figure out the entire system, including tooling and productivity, is a full-stack approach that is really cool and provides a comprehensive understanding of the system [(00:16:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=985s).
- Many people in web programming only focus on the front end and assume someone else will handle the back end, but being a generalist and having a broad range of skills is valuable [(00:17:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1021s).
- Being a generalist means being able to do a variety of tasks, such as building a websocket connection, working with memory, and building UI, without specializing in one specific activity [(00:17:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1040s).
- [[DevOps]] is not a special ops team of programmers, but rather the people who ensure that a service can operate at scale and does not disappear after launch, providing the backbone for operating something at scale [(00:18:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1106s).
- DevOps is necessary when things need to scale, and it involves making sure that the service can handle the demand, which is not necessary for small, simple websites [(00:18:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1138s).
- The individuals responsible for managing compute infrastructure and ensuring that systems do not fail are highly skilled and play a crucial role, often referred to as wizards in their field, with various job titles such as site reliability engineers [(00:19:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1142s).
- These professionals are essential to the smooth operation of organizations, particularly in the context of DevOps, which generally refers to the management of servers, their life cycles, and reliability [(00:19:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1179s).
- The term DevOps can be somewhat ambiguous, with different people having specific interpretations, and some individuals may distinguish between various roles such as infrastructure engineers and site reliability engineers [(00:19:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1181s).
- The question of whether DevOps is a distinct and meaningful concept is raised, with some uncertainty expressed about its validity and the potential impact of certain events or developments, such as Verscell, on the field [(00:19:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1196s).
- The discussion touches on the idea that the perception of [[DevOps]] may have been influenced by various factors, leading to a reevaluation of its significance and relevance in the industry [(00:20:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1204s).

## Life story [(00:20:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1208s)
- The individual's life journey began at a young age, with exposure to pornography at around four or five years old, which had a significant impact on their life for a large portion of their childhood and teenage years [(00:21:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1275s).
- At the age of seven, the individual's father died, which was a difficult period in their life, and they recall a peculiar experience of being instructed to refer to [[God]] as "dad" during a trip to [[China]] [(00:21:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1306s).
- As they grew older, they developed an interest in computers and discovered programming through a game called Grail Online, created by a person known as Lord Talk on [[Twitch (service) | Twitch]], which had a level editor and a scripting language [(00:22:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1362s).
- The individual struggled socially in high school, feeling out of place and experiencing bullying, but found solace in programming and online activities [(00:23:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1388s).
- After their father's death, their older brother introduced them to marijuana at the age of eight, and they smoked it until they were around 11 or 12 years old [(00:23:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1421s).
- The individual's early life was marked by significant challenges, including [[Addiction | addiction]], social struggles, and personal losses, but they eventually found success as a programmer and an inspiration to others [(00:21:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1262s).
- Experiences of drinking and other activities started at a young age, around 15 to 18 years old, and led to feelings of sadness and a poor attempt at suicide after graduating from high school [(00:23:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1430s).
- After a hospital visit, there was a moment of realization, similar to a character's experience in the book "Wheel of Time" where the main character Rand has to kill a girl, which marked a breaking point [(00:24:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1469s).
- This breaking point led to a loss of social awkwardness, but also a loss of other emotions and motivations, resulting in the use of drugs such as LSD, mushrooms, and [[Methamphetamine | meth]] [(00:25:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1506s).
- The use of these substances led to negative effects, including visual disturbances from taking too much acid, and an overall period of poor decisions [(00:25:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1524s).
- At around 19 years old, there was a dramatic and real presence of [[God]] felt, which led to a choice to change life and a desire to stop pretending to be someone else [(00:25:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1546s).
- Although nothing changed immediately, the next day brought a sense of shame when engaging in certain activities, such as looking at porn or smoking pot, which served as a catalyst for change [(00:26:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1590s).
- This newfound sense of shame and consciousness led to a change in behavior, including trying harder in school, which was a significant departure from the previous poor academic performance, with a high school GPA of 2.14 [(00:27:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1625s).
- The individual was not a great student, receiving poor grades and even being told by a teacher that they were the worst student they had ever had, which prompted a change in their approach to learning [(00:27:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1630s).
- Despite initial struggles, including failing pre-calculus, the individual spent hours studying and eventually experienced a significant improvement in their math skills, becoming one of the best in their class about a year and a half into their journey [(00:27:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1669s).
- This improvement in math skills also translated to their computer science classes, where they began to excel, and they developed a love for the process of learning, which was motivated by a desire to achieve something, not because they expected it to get easier [(00:28:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1701s).
- The individual also struggled with addictions, including porn and smoking, but was finally able to overcome them around the age of 22, after which they focused on personal growth and development [(00:28:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1730s).
- After overcoming their addictions, the individual met their wife and started to focus on their career, including programming, which they did for extended periods of time, sometimes up to 24 or 36 hours straight [(00:29:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1776s).
- The individual's passion for programming led them to start their first startup, which they worked on tirelessly, often neglecting other aspects of their life, including their relationship with their wife [(00:29:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1790s).
- This period of intense focus on programming and personal growth was a defining period in the individual's life, shaping who they are today [(00:30:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1807s).

## Hardship [(00:30:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1812s)
- The discussion about hardship begins with an attempt to reverse engineer the pain and triumph experienced, and understand it better, particularly in relation to the loss of a father at a young age [(00:30:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1812s).
- Losing a dad at the age of 7 had a significant impact, but the exact memories of that time are unclear, possibly due to being young enough to repress or not have the capability of remembering things long term [(00:30:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1821s).
- The loss of a dad at a young age may have been less traumatic than if it had occurred later, such as at 11 or 12, which was the age of a brother who fell into drug [[Addiction | addiction]] and never recovered [(00:30:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1850s).
- The longing for a dad had a significant impact on evolution and life, leading to social difficulties and a constant search for approval, which was sought in various things due to the absence of a loving figure [(00:31:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1867s).
- This search for approval was not a conscious effort, but rather a subconscious attempt to fill the void left by the loss of a father, and it influenced actions and behaviors over time [(00:31:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1891s).

## High school [(00:31:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1904s)
- High school can be a challenging time for many individuals, who may feel like outsiders, get picked on, and struggle with complexities at home, and it is essential to remember that the people surrounding them during this period will likely be some of the least consequential in their life [(00:31:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1904s).
- The high school experience can feel eternal, and it is common for individuals to think that their peers will be present for the rest of their life, which can be a shocking realization to later discover is not the case [(00:31:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1916s).
- High school can be viewed as a trial run or a tutorial, where individuals can try new things, take risks, and experiment without severe consequences, which can help build confidence and prepare them for real life [(00:32:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=1964s).
- Engaging in activities like [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] (BJJ) or other sports can help individuals, especially males, develop confidence and physical abilities, which can be beneficial in high school and beyond [(00:33:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2020s).
- It is crucial to remember that high school is a short and tiny moment in life, and the experiences and social hierarchy of this period do not define an individual's entire life, which can be a huge help in coping with the challenges of this time [(00:34:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2045s).
- The psychological difficulties of being a high schooler should not be underestimated, as the pressure to conform to social hierarchies and the fear of being low in status can have severe consequences, including depression and suicidal thoughts [(00:34:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2083s).
- The challenges of high school may be even more significant today than in the past, making it essential for individuals to be aware of these difficulties and to support those who are struggling [(00:35:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2100s).
- The concept of being "cool" has changed over time, shifting from a qualitative assessment to a quantitative one, where a person's social value can be measured by the number of followers or likes they have on social media, making it potentially more damaging to be considered "uncool" [(00:35:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2110s).
- The challenge is to remember that being considered "uncool" by one's social circle in high school does not necessarily mean that a person is actually uncool, and that it is possible to find and cultivate one's own unique sense of coolness [(00:35:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2145s).
- High school is not effective at identifying truly "cool" people, as the hierarchy that forms is often based on superficial qualities such as material possessions, and the people who excel in this environment may not be the ones who succeed in the broader game of life [(00:36:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2176s).
- The "weirdos" in high school, who may be bullied or tormented, are often the ones who will succeed in the long run, as they are forced to think critically and explore their own minds, whereas those who are popular in high school may not be challenged to self-reflect or try new things [(00:37:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2222s).
- Being tormented or challenged in high school can have a positive effect, as long as it does not become overwhelming, as it can prompt individuals to think deeply about what it means to be human and to develop their own unique perspectives [(00:37:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2240s).

## Porn addiction [(00:37:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2250s)
- Porn [[Addiction | addiction]] is a powerful and difficult issue to overcome, partly because it is not widely recognized as a serious addiction and is often viewed as a private matter that can be hidden from others [(00:37:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2251s).
- This type of addiction can be particularly challenging to overcome because it is easy to access and can be practiced in private, allowing individuals to hide it from the world for prolonged periods of time [(00:37:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2269s).
- The impact of porn addiction on one's life can be significant, including a distorted view of women and a tendency to objectify them, which can lead to devaluing humanity and viewing people as commodities [(00:38:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2337s).
- Overcoming porn addiction requires recognizing its effects on one's perspective and behavior, including the way it can lead to consumerism and materialism, and understanding the science behind addiction, such as the dopamine effect [(00:40:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2415s).
- The private and easily accessible nature of porn addiction makes it difficult to quit, as individuals can quickly and easily access porn without others knowing, and then return to their daily activities without anyone being aware [(00:40:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2422s).
- The effects of porn addiction can be long-lasting and deep-seated, influencing one's relationships and interactions with others, particularly women, and can lead to a broken and distorted view of them [(00:39:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2340s).
- Recognizing the harm caused by porn [[Addiction | addiction]] and seeking to overcome it requires a willingness to re-evaluate one's values and perspective, and to recognize the value and dignity of all individuals [(00:39:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2399s).
- The concept of watching porn is viewed as a constant dopamine cycle that can be detrimental to one's well-being, and it is considered to devalue intimacy and human connection, even if statistics suggest otherwise [(00:40:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2452s).
- The "manosphere" is criticized for making sleeping with multiple women the primary objective of life, which can lead to an addiction and devalue the importance of deep friendships and relationships [(00:41:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2501s).
- Intimacy and deep connections with others are considered to be more valuable and meaningful than casual sex or porn, and it is argued that a life with meaningful relationships is more fulfilling than one focused on superficial interactions [(00:42:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2521s).
- Having a deep friendship or romantic partnership is considered to be a more meaningful and valuable experience than having meaningless sex, and it is argued that there is no universe where a person with meaningless sex has a better or more meaningful life [(00:42:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2564s).
- Getting laid can have a positive impact on a young man's confidence, but it is not the most important thing in life, and it is suggested that releasing the nervousness around sex can allow people to see the world more clearly and find meaningful connections [(00:43:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2592s).
- Society's emphasis on getting laid can cloud one's judgment, but once this pressure is released, people can focus on finding meaningful relationships, including romantic partnerships and deep, lasting friendships [(00:44:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2651s).
- The idea that getting rich or achieving a certain status can solve problems is mentioned, with a reference to Jim Carrey's quote that everyone should get rich so they can realize that money does not solve everything [(00:44:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2672s).
- The realization that societal expectations may not be the most important aspect of a relationship is a significant sign of a healthy partnership, as a lack of sex in a relationship can indicate underlying issues, but having a lot of sex does not necessarily mean the relationship is good [(00:44:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2677s).
- Quitting porn can be challenging due to its dopamine effect, but having a deep and trusting relationship with one's partner is more rewarding, and making an effort not to look at other women or porn can help build trust and confidence in the relationship [(00:45:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2714s).
- Having complete confidence and trust in each other is crucial for building a deep and meaningful relationship, and the depth of the relationship is likely proportional to the trust between partners [(00:45:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2737s).
- Vulnerability is a key component of trust, and taking the leap of being vulnerable with another person can lead to strong trust and a beautiful relationship when reciprocated [(00:46:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2762s).
- Being vulnerable can be challenging, especially for those with a large social following, but it is always worth the risk as it can lead to meaningful connections and personal growth, and saidQuestioner's experience of finding his wife, which has been the most impactful thing in his life after a transformative experience with [[God]] [(00:46:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2781s).
- Finding a life partner, such as a wife, can be a life-changing experience that can lead to personal growth and positive changes, such as becoming more responsible and self-sufficient, as seen in the case of the person who claims to be a "changed man" after finding his wife [(00:46:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2817s).

## God [(00:47:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2836s)
- The moment of finding God at 19 was a significant turning point, as it marked the beginning of a journey to escape pain and [[Addiction | addiction]], and it was characterized by a deep fear and understanding of the path being taken [(00:47:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2837s).
- The worth and value were previously wrapped up in having sex or getting laid, which is a terrible place to have one's worth, and it all came to a point where a choice had to be made [(00:48:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2893s).
- The night of the choice was not special in itself, but it was special because it provided a chance to make a choice, and the details of the night are not important, except that it was nighttime and at [[Montana State University]] [(00:48:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2913s).
- To overcome porn addiction, it is necessary to realize that it is taking something away from the future, such as a future wife, and this realization can help to change behavior, even if it is not a straightforward or easy process [(00:49:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2954s).
- The problem of addiction cannot be solved by replacing it with something else, such as a girlfriend, but rather by addressing the underlying issues and making a conscious choice to change [(00:49:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2962s).
- There is no silver bullet to help people change, and it is a complex and individual process, but making a choice and taking responsibility for one's actions can be an important step towards positive change [(00:50:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3001s).
- The pursuit of happiness and fulfillment can lead individuals to seek satisfaction in various ways, including [[Addiction | addiction]] to pornography, which ultimately does not provide the desired satisfaction and can be addicting [(00:50:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3042s).
- Recognizing that certain behaviors or addictions are preventing one from finding their path to a flourishing life is crucial, and imagining a happy life can help individuals construct their life in a way that allows them to travel down those paths [(00:51:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3089s).
- Removing things that prevent one from walking down their desired path, such as addiction to pornography, requires a leap of faith that a better life is waiting on the other end, and for some, this can lead to valuable relationships and personal growth [(00:52:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3140s).
- Valuing relationships and people properly requires a clear and unbiased perspective, which can be hindered by addiction or unhealthy behaviors, and making positive changes can lead to more meaningful and valuable relationships [(00:52:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3165s).
- Experimenting with substances like [[Methamphetamine | meth]], LSD, and Iawaska can be a serious risk, with unpredictable outcomes, and while some may have positive experiences, others may have negative and potentially life-destroying experiences [(00:53:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3211s).
- The use of Iawaska, in particular, is viewed differently by various people, with some speaking positively and others negatively, and it is essential to approach such substances with caution and awareness of the potential risks [(00:53:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3205s).
- Biochemistry and individual reactions to substances can vary greatly, and what may be a positive experience for one person can be devastating for another, making it challenging to provide a recommendation for or against using such substances [(00:54:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3247s).
- Ultimately, the decision to engage in certain behaviors or experiment with substances requires careful consideration and a willingness to lean into life's uncertainties and potential risks [(00:54:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3263s).
- The use of drugs can have a profound impact on the biochemistry of the brain, potentially leading to self-destruction and long-term torment, which is why it is generally recommended to avoid drugs altogether, unless one is willing to take extreme risks, like [[Hunter S. Thompson | Hunter S Thompson]] [(00:54:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3285s).
- Hallucinogenic experiences can be unpredictable and vary greatly from person to person, with no guarantee of a positive experience, and some people may view these experiences as merely a result of chemicals interacting in the brain, while others, like the individual, believe in the spiritual realm and the existence of demons, angels, and [[God]] [(00:55:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3320s).
- The individual has had profound and varied experiences with LSD, including bizarre, cool, and awful experiences, and while they would not take back the choices they made, they do not think it is necessary for others to have such experiences to make good decisions or realize the value of people [(00:55:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3355s).
- [[Methamphetamine | Meth]] is compared to cocaine, but with a longer duration of the intense, unpleasant feeling that follows the initial high, lasting for around 12 hours, and the individual found it to be an intense experience that fed into their ADHD nature, making them high energy and always in the moment [(00:56:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3390s).
- The experience of being on meth is described as intense and all-consuming, but not necessarily pleasant, and it is noted that people who use drugs often fall into two categories: those who prefer opioids and those who prefer uppers, with few people using both, and the individual's experience with meth was influenced by their ADHD nature [(00:57:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3462s).
- Some individuals perceive nervousness or anxiety in a situation as a thrilling experience, while others may view it as the worst experience of their lifetime, with some people even preferring death over public speaking, and this concept is relevant to the discussion of substance use and its effects [(00:57:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3473s).
- Meth was used to experience a thrilling sensation, but it did not provide the desired outcome, and instead, it was used in an attempt to achieve a specific goal, but ultimately, it was not fulfilling [(00:58:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3505s).
- There have been wonderful experiences with substances, but it is not recommended to try them, and a distinction is made between having a positive experience and promoting or encouraging others to try the same, with a focus on the importance of responsible communication [(00:58:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3524s).
- Alcohol can be used to alleviate social anxiety, but it is not the alcohol itself that is essential, rather the social signaling that comes with having a drink, and it is possible to have fun without drinking by using alternative methods, such as pretending to drink [(00:59:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3572s).
- Traveling and cultural experiences may involve drinking, but it is not a necessary component of social interactions, and it is possible to have fun without drinking, with the key takeaway being that life can be enjoyable without substances [(01:00:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3646s).
- The use of drugs can have a negative effect on most people in the long term, and it is recommended to choose a life without drugs, as it can lead to greater opportunities and a more fulfilling life, with the example of potentially becoming the president of the [[United States]] [(01:01:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3670s).
- Self-awareness and humor are considered wonderful, and being able to laugh at oneself is a valuable trait [(01:01:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3712s).
- The use of drugs is seen as a form of escapism, and it is believed that people use them to try to feel something that cannot be achieved through other means, such as finding meaning in their job [(01:01:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3719s).
- While it is possible to find satisfaction and happiness in one's work, such as in programming, it is unlikely to find purpose in it, although there may be some exceptions, like being an EMT and saving someone's life [(01:02:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3748s).
- Drugs can serve as a great distraction, but they ultimately come with a heavy cost, and at some point, the negative consequences will become apparent, making it a trade-off that may not be worth it [(01:02:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3767s).
- The idea of finding purpose is complex, and it is acknowledged that some people may find purpose in their jobs, but for many, including programmers, it is unlikely to be found solely in their work [(01:02:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3754s).
- The pursuit of feeling something that cannot be achieved through other means can lead to [[Addiction | addiction]], and it is a costly distraction that can have severe consequences, as suggested by the reference to Dr. FA [(01:02:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3769s).

## Perseverance [(01:02:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3779s)
- The individual failed pre-calculus multiple times, taking the class three times before finally passing with a C, and then went on to excel in calculus and differential equations, earning the highest scores in the school [(01:03:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3781s).
- To achieve this turnaround, the individual dedicated themselves to intense study, attending classes, visiting the math learning center, and practicing problems from the book until they could solve them easily, relying on repetition and memorization to build their skills [(01:04:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3865s).
- The key to improvement was putting in the time and effort, with the individual noting that there is no substitute for hours of practice, and that even if it feels crushing and defeating at first, consistent effort will eventually lead to progress and improvement [(01:05:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3924s).
- The individual's learning style is concrete, preferring to start with practical examples and then move to abstract concepts, and they advise others to find a similar approach that works for them, emphasizing the importance of persistence and dedication [(01:05:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3907s).
- The process of learning and improving is compared to playing a musical instrument, where initially, one must focus on the basics, but as skills improve, it becomes possible to explore and express oneself more freely, and a similar transition occurs in programming, where crossing a certain barrier can make the activity feel magical rather than a chore [(01:05:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3955s).
- The concept of having a successful life is often accompanied by the idea that one must overcome barriers, and that nothing comes easily, with the understanding that everything requires a lot of pain and struggle [(01:06:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3984s).
- The phrase "work smarter, not harder" is disliked because it implies that there is an easy, obvious path to success, and that one should not have to try very hard, which is not a realistic or relatable experience for many people [(01:06:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4008s).
- The dislike for the phrase "work smarter, not harder" stems from the hidden suggestion that one already knows what the "smart" approach is, and that things should be easy, which is not always the case, and that the only way to learn how to work smart is by working very hard [(01:06:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4015s).
- The idea that things should be easy and that one is a failure if they don't see the easy path is a problematic presumption that can make people who struggle feel like failures, leading them to choose laziness over hard work [(01:07:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4074s).
- Great engineers often find the smart way to do things, but only after putting in extremely hard work, and they sometimes forget the hard work they put in, which can lead them to give unrealistic advice to others [(01:08:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4103s).
- The process of learning and mastering a skill, such as playing a musical instrument or practicing jiu-jitsu, requires thousands of hours of hard work and dedication, and that even learning to relax and use the correct techniques takes a lot of time and effort [(01:09:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4140s).
- The journey to mastering a skill is often accompanied by feelings of frustration, depression, and shattered ego, but it is through these experiences that one can eventually figure out the correct approach and make progress [(01:09:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4181s).
- The process of growth and self-improvement involves using insights gained from experiences to learn and improve, and this cycle of growth can be applied to various skills such as jiu-jitsu, judo, piano, or guitar [(01:10:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4211s).
- The idea that the journey is better than the destination is considered to be a flawed concept, as it implies that the destination is inherently worse, and instead, people should focus on enjoying the journey and celebrating the destination [(01:11:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4263s).
- Some phrases and quotes, such as those found on demotivational posters, can be misleading or lacking in logical depth, and can have a negative impact on people's motivations and perceptions [(01:11:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4285s).
- The importance of progress and moving forward, even if it's not always in the right direction, is highlighted, and the value of learning from mistakes and persevering is emphasized [(01:11:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4308s).
- The role of family and personal relationships in shaping one's motivations and values is discussed, and the influence of a mother's hard work and dedication is particularly noted as a source of inspiration [(01:12:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4339s).
- The concept of work ethic and dedication is highlighted, with the phrase "work hard get smart" being suggested as a more accurate and meaningful motto [(01:10:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4246s).
- The idea that positivity and motivation can be fleeting, and that it's normal for people to experience setbacks and challenges, is acknowledged, and the importance of persistence and resilience is stressed [(01:12:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4320s).

## Netflix [(01:12:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4375s)
- The individual worked at [[Netflix]], and prior to that, they had their own startup, which was built using [[PHP]] and [[JQuery | jQuery]], and was focused on text message marketing, a concept that was about half a decade too early, [(01:12:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4377s).
- The startup, called "Via Text", allowed users to receive texts about various deals, and although it failed, the concept of text message marketing is now widely used, [(01:13:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4399s).
- The individual's father also had a startup in the telecommunications space, a phone card company that allowed users to pre-purchase long distance minutes, which was about six years ahead of its time, [(01:14:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4452s).
- The individual's experience with their startup and their father's startup suggests that they may be ahead of their time, but they attribute their timing to luck rather than being visionary, [(01:15:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4516s).
- After their startup failed, the individual had to get a real job and was living in an apartment in [[Bozeman, Montana]], where they had a difficult neighbor who would often threaten and scream at them, [(01:15:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4557s).
- The individual's wife had an incident with the angry neighbor when she dropped a double A battery, which triggered a reaction from the neighbor, [(01:16:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4575s).
- The individual had to get a real job and worked at a small place, which was boring, before moving to a company called Web Filings, where they worked long hours and learned about corporate life, communication, and various technologies, including RxJS, a technology from 2013 [(01:16:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4584s).
- At Web Filings, the individual had to build systems, work on complex state machines for the UI, and do a lot of "matricy stuff," which pushed them to work 60 hours a week, resulting in an unhealthy work-life balance [(01:17:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4671s).
- The experience at Web Filings helped the individual develop a strong understanding of complex technologies, which made them able to talk about these topics commandingly, and eventually led to them being noticed by companies like [[Netflix]] [(01:18:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4690s).
- Netflix, specifically a manager named Jeff Wagner, reached out to the individual for an interview, citing their experience with RxJS, and the individual decided to interview, which ultimately led to them getting the job [(01:18:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4716s).
- During the interview process, the individual realized they would have to make a decision about moving to [[California]], as they were confident about getting the job, and they were doing well in the interview [(01:19:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4752s).
- The individual's journey involved exploring startups, building and finishing projects, learning about corporate life, and working with various technologies, including RxJS, which was a key factor in their recruitment by Netflix [(01:16:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4594s).
- The individual had confidence in getting a job at Netflix due to their extensive preparation, having worked 80 hours a week for 5 years, and their goal was to showcase their existing knowledge, which ultimately led to them getting hired at Netflix in 2013 [(01:19:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4782s).
- Netflix was located in [[Los Gatos, California]], which is near [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland, California | Oakland]], and [[San Jose, California | San Jose]], and is part of the same contiguous city area [(01:20:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4820s).
- The individual does not identify with the typical [[Montana]] stereotypes, such as riding a horse to campus, but does have a romantic admiration for the natural beauty of Montana, as depicted in shows like [[Yellowstone (American TV series) | Yellowstone]] [(01:20:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4839s).
- The individual has experience with rural activities, such as shooting gophers, and has had horses on their property, which they offered to their neighbor after one of their horses broke its leg [(01:20:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4850s).
- The individual appreciates the energy and excitement of the Silicon Valley area, where everyone is focused on building or creating something, but acknowledges that Montana has a different atmosphere and does not have the same level of excitement or energy [(01:21:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4897s).
- The individual has had experience with cattle, specifically open cows, which are cows that have tried to get pregnant but did not, and has had them on their property [(01:22:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4961s).
- The process of managing open cows involves allowing them to graze in pastures for a year before they are used for meat production, and attempting to milk them would be unsuccessful as they are not bred for that purpose [(01:23:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=4981s).
- [[Reddit]] is not considered a reliable source for gaining wisdom or accurate information about individuals [(01:23:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5015s).
- Taking a job at [[Netflix]] in 2013 was a significant decision, especially considering the company's culture of hiring and firing quickly, and it was made more challenging by the fact that the individual's wife was 36 weeks pregnant at the time [(01:23:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5030s).
- The experience of working at Netflix was intense and difficult, particularly due to the company's bold approach to firing underperforming employees, and it was exacerbated by the individual's wife being pregnant and them having to navigate a new location without a support system [(01:24:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5071s).
- The individual's first child was born during this time, and the experience of having a new baby was very challenging, especially without the support of family members, and it took a greater toll on the individual's wife [(01:25:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5113s).

## Groovy [(01:25:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5123s)
- The technical learning curve involved learning about the stack used by Netflix, which has an incredible infrastructure to deliver a huge amount of data, and is considered to have a fundamentally easier problem than other companies like [[YouTube]], due to its specific requirements [(01:25:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5123s).
- When first starting, the task was to learn some code and come back in a couple of days to start fixing bugs, and this involved working with a [[PlayStation 3]], as part of the TV team, to launch programs and figure out how to work with [[Netflix]] on a [[Television | television]] device [(01:26:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5177s).
- The TV team had to work with different kinds of devices, including [[PlayStation]] 3s, and other devices that plugged into TVs, and at that time, not many TVs had Netflix, and even fewer had the newer Darwin app [(01:26:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5190s).
- The back end or middle end of the stack was written in [[Apache Groovy | Groovy]], a [[Java virtual machine | JVM]] language that is a powerful object-oriented programming language, but is not widely liked, with most people having negative experiences with it [(01:27:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5231s).
- Groovy is an Apache language, released in 2007, that combines static and dynamic typing capabilities, but is not considered a great language by most people who have worked with it [(01:27:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5248s).
- The experience of working with Groovy was challenging, with nobody at Netflix having a good understanding of how it worked, and people just hacking together scripts to make it work, which was a nightmare, especially with the custom version called WX [(01:28:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5282s).
- The use of RX, or the custom version WX, was particularly problematic, with issues like observables and threading, and an example of trying to use it to make a thread sleep, which ended up turning off all of staging [(01:28:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5300s).
- The process of debugging a system that was not responding led to the discovery that it was not multi-threaded, contrary to initial assumptions, and this realization caused significant disruptions to the work of other developers [(01:28:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5337s).
- The task of rewriting the data structure on the front end for the TV involved changing it from a list of lists of movies to a list of lists of recommendation objects for a movie, which was necessary to provide more detailed information about why a particular movie was recommended [(01:29:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5361s).
- The new data structure allowed for the addition of one level of indirection, enabling the decoration of videos with recommendation information, and this change helped to abstract away the space of recommendations from the space of movies [(01:29:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5386s).
- The implementation of the new data structure was done in the [[Apache Groovy | Groovy]] programming language, which was considered a radical language at the time, and the person who implemented it became the go-to expert for such tasks after reading the language reference for a day and successfully programming it [(01:30:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5410s).
- The willingness to take on tasks that no one else was willing to do, such as debugging and implementing new data structures, led to increased responsibilities and opportunities for growth [(01:30:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5426s).

## Printf() debugging [(01:30:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5427s)
- The process of going into a codebase and figuring out how it works, including identifying flaws and assumptions, is a challenging task that requires reverse engineering and print debugging, which involves using print statements to understand the code's behavior [(01:30:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5427s).
- Print debugging is a skill that can be developed through experience, such as writing robots for the government, where the only way to get anything out of the machine was to use print statements to understand the code [(01:31:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5466s).
- This skill is useful in situations where the codebase is complex, and the developer is not familiar with it, such as when working with machines on AWS that are not easily accessible [(01:32:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5521s).
- The ability to drop into any codebase and use print debugging to understand it is a valuable skill, as it allows developers to quickly figure out why things are happening in a particular way [(01:32:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5547s).
- Print debugging involves using print statements to confirm intuitions, test hypotheses, and build up more information about the codebase, which can help developers accumulate a bigger picture of the system and identify edge cases that break it [(01:32:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5568s).
- This skill is not common among engineers, and many may find it intimidating to come into a codebase and try to understand it from scratch, but it is a powerful tool for developers who can master it [(01:33:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5595s).
- The fundamental problem of web development is that developers often have to work with complex codebases that they did not create, and print debugging is one way to approach this problem [(01:33:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5604s).
- Understanding and learning from existing codebases is a crucial skill set, as it allows developers to build upon the wisdom and solved problems of the past, rather than starting from scratch and potentially reinventing the wheel [(01:33:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5613s).
- A personal experience with a developer who wrote code in a unique way led to a realization that rewriting the code from scratch resulted in almost identical code, highlighting the importance of taking the time to learn from others' work [(01:34:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5656s).
- Investing time in understanding existing codebases and figuring out why certain decisions were made is a more efficient way to understand a problem deeply, despite the temptation to start from scratch [(01:35:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5739s).
- Starting from scratch can be beneficial for understanding a concept, such as creating a [[Transmission Control Protocol | TCP]] socket to learn how an [[HTTP]] server works, as it provides a deeper understanding of the underlying principles [(01:36:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5780s).
- Gaining new perspectives and understanding of complex systems can be achieved by parsing and learning from existing code, allowing developers to appreciate the reasoning behind certain design decisions [(01:36:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5807s).

## Falcor [(01:36:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5809s)
- The legend of a simplified version of a [[Denial-of-service attack | DDoS]] (distributed denial of service) attack, specifically a DOS, has been circulating on [[Reddit]], and it is related to the Falcore system at [[Netflix]], where a bug was discovered that could bring down the system [(01:36:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5814s).
- The bug, known as the "Repulsive Grizzly Attack," was reported to security and was so severe that it got its own name, and examples of how to execute it were even provided [(01:37:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5856s).
- The attack works by targeting both memory and CPU with a request, and it can be achieved through frameworks like [[GraphQL]], which are vulnerable to this kind of attack [(01:37:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5867s).
- The Falcore system allows users to request specific data using a compact format, but if a user requests an excessive amount of data, such as rows 0 through 10,000 and columns 0 through 10,000, it can create billions of objects in the [[Java virtual machine | JVM]] and bring down the machine [(01:39:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5979s).
- The attack vector involves a simple while loop that can take down and hold down a system like Netflix for a long time, and it is related to the materialize flag, which is used to fill in requested data [(01:40:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6006s).
- The discovery of the bug and the creation of the first fix for it were significant, but the person who discovered it was not mentioned in the article that was written about it, which is a bit upsetting [(01:37:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=5874s).
- A single request could kill one machine on AWS, shutting down the entire UI, and this issue had been in production for years, making it difficult to roll back and fix, with the only option being to roll back to 2011 [(01:40:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6020s).
- The infrastructure serving the videos would shut down, and although streaming video was still possible, it was impossible to access the videos due to the UI being completely shut down, and this was not a [[Denial-of-service attack | DDoS]] attack as it did not require a large number of requests to overwhelm the system [(01:41:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6061s).
- Defending against all possible attack vectors is extremely difficult, and any sufficiently complicated software system can be overwhelmed, which is why services like [[Cloudflare]] are used to protect against such attacks [(01:41:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6091s).
- DOS attacks can be carried out with a small number of requests, and they do not need to be sophisticated, as they can simply deny service, and there are various types of attacks, including reax expansion attacks, that can shut down a service [(01:42:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6135s).
- The web is a difficult place to ensure security, and there are many bad actors, including black hat hackers, with a wide range of skill sets, from simple script kitties to sophisticated social engineers, who constantly try to attack and exploit vulnerabilities [(01:43:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6192s).
- Social engineering is a common method of hacking, where attacks are carried out not with computers, but through human interaction, and there are many examples of successful social engineering attacks, including those carried out by [[Kevin Mitnick]] [(01:43:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6210s).
- The concept of hacking is explored, including the idea that people can be easily tricked into revealing sensitive information, such as PINs, by pretending to be someone else, like Charlene, and that this is a common tactic used by hackers [(01:43:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6217s).
- There are white hat hackers who discover vulnerabilities and report them, and black hat hackers who exploit them for malicious purposes, but the process of discovering vulnerabilities is the same for both, and black hat hackers have an easier job in taking advantage of them for longer periods of time [(01:43:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6239s).
- Most software is held together by "toothpicks and glue" and has many dangers, and social engineering is a significant attack vector that can cause a lot of damage, especially as AI tooling becomes easier to use [(01:44:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6272s).
- The social engineering aspect of hacking is a major concern, and it's assumed that whenever someone approaches with a request, it's a potential social engineering project or attack vector [(01:45:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6302s).
- The integration of AI into systems makes them more vulnerable to attacks, such as prompt injection, which is a difficult thing to defend against because it's not clear how to defend against it [(01:45:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6325s).
- The future of AI-powered systems is likely to be vulnerable to various attacks, and it's challenging to reason about the potential risks and edge cases, making it essential to be cautious when giving powers to these systems [(01:46:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6372s).

## Breaking production [(01:46:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6379s)
- The more power given to software systems, the more damage they can do, but also the more awesome things they can accomplish, and this is a delicate balance that human civilization must navigate [(01:46:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6379s).
- Breaking production has occurred multiple times due to various reasons, such as a misunderstanding of how [[PHP]] handles static variables, which led to bad data being displayed on the website [(01:46:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6411s).
- One instance of breaking production occurred when a countdown feature on the website for Lady Gaga's video release froze when it reached zero, causing frustration among the team and people in Hollywood [(01:47:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6449s).
- Another instance involved releasing a bug that caused an infinite loop when the "add to my list" button was pressed on the billboard website, resulting in the webpage freezing [(01:47:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6479s).
- Some bugs, such as the infinite loop, can be easy to discover in hindsight, but may be difficult to identify during the development process, and even manual QA may miss them [(01:48:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6492s).
- The use of global variables in PHP can also lead to tricky bugs that are hard to discover, as they can be relied upon but also overwritten by other parts of the code, causing data races [(01:48:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6514s).
- The importance of understanding the nuances of programming languages, such as the difference between static variables in PHP and other languages, is crucial to avoiding mistakes that can break production [(01:48:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6531s).

## Pieter Levels [(01:49:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6544s)
- Pieter Levels is a solo developer who often ships to production without testing, which can be beneficial for smaller organizations or solo projects, but may not be suitable for larger companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Netflix]], or [[Google]] [(01:49:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6545s).
- The approach of pushing directly to production depends on the application's complexity, the number of people working on it, and the potential consequences of errors, making it essential to gauge these factors before adopting this approach [(01:49:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6570s).
- Not all applications are created equal, and some may require more rigorous testing, such as those with deep logic or complex libraries, whereas others, like visual-focused applications, may be easier to test and push to production [(01:50:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6619s).
- Pieter Levels' tech stack, which includes [[PHP]], [[JQuery | jQuery]], and [[SQL | SQLite]], is notable, and while jQuery may seem outdated, it can still be a viable choice if it gets the job done quickly without significant performance issues [(01:51:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6699s).
- The decision to stick with a familiar tech stack, like jQuery, is often driven by the ability to work efficiently, but it's also important to explore and learn new tools to avoid missing out on potential improvements or more efficient solutions [(01:52:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6741s).
- There is a trade-off between using a familiar tool belt and exploring new ones, as the former provides comfort and efficiency, but the latter can lead to discovering better ways to solve problems or represent states in a more efficient manner [(01:52:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6766s).
- It's valuable to be able to look at problems from different perspectives and not get stuck on one particular approach or tool, as this can lead to missing out on opportunities to improve or find more efficient solutions [(01:53:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6805s).

## Netflix, Twitch, and YouTube infrastructure [(01:53:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6814s)
- The infrastructure of platforms like [[Netflix]], [[Twitch (service) | Twitch]], and [[YouTube]] is incredibly complex, with YouTube having over 100 billion views a day and over 1 billion hours of watch time, as well as 1 million hours of videos uploaded every day [(01:53:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6814s).
- The creator side of YouTube is unique in that 1 million hours of videos are uploaded every day, requiring the platform to service both the consumption and creation of content [(01:54:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6844s).
- Delivering this kind of infrastructure is a vastly complicated task, especially when it comes to creating an edge, or a point where data is delivered to the user as quickly as possible [(01:54:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6865s).
- The speed of light, number of hops, and amount of services that need to be remotely called all add up and create inefficiencies in the system, making it difficult to cache data and deliver it quickly [(01:54:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6888s).
- YouTube's data changes constantly, and relevance is almost directly tied to the newness of the item, making it essential to have an incredible caching network to deliver new content as quickly as possible [(01:55:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6903s).
- The recommendation system on YouTube is also complex, as it needs to integrate new content into the system while caching a large cluster of possible videos that the user may be interested in, as well as integrate ads [(01:55:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6953s).
- The problem of caching and delivering content on [[YouTube]] is a tough one, as it involves thinking about the cache hit rate and the amount of space needed to store the data, with the platform likely having to think in terms of petabytes or larger units of data [(01:56:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=6985s).
- [[Netflix]], on the other hand, has a much easier job when it comes to caching, as it knows what videos are being released and what videos are popular in specific areas, allowing it to use a system called OCA to manage its caching [(01:56:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7007s).
- The process of making decisions and taking actions in large companies like YouTube is different from smaller entities, and it's impressive how companies like [[Twitch (service) | Twitch]] handle complex tasks such as ingesting and transforming video formats in real-time [(01:57:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7026s).
- The engineering problem of allowing fast iteration and addition of features without impacting the whole codebase is a significant challenge, especially in large teams where multiple organizations and layers are involved [(01:57:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7076s).
- The example of Netflix adopting the dystopian series [[Black Mirror]] and wanting to change the order of episodes is used to illustrate the complexity of making changes in large companies, which often requires gathering multiple engineers and having meetings with various teams [(01:59:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7145s).
- The problem of big companies is that every little thing has to become its own team, and even small features require a significant amount of resources and bureaucracy, making it difficult to accelerate decision-making and implementation [(01:59:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7172s).
- The goal is to find a way to scale companies without slowing down decision-making and implementation, and Elon's teams are cited as an example of being able to maintain speed and efficiency even as the company grows [(01:59:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7198s).
- The use of specific tools and systems, such as a movie metadata warehouse, can help facilitate decision-making and implementation in large companies, but the key is to find a process that allows for quick and efficient decision-making [(02:00:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7228s).
- Managing multiple tasks and teams is crucial, as seen in the example of working on a project that requires reversing episode numbers and season numbers, and the ability to hide or show this information, which is a complex problem that needs to be addressed for the UI, data storage, and service layer [(02:00:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7241s).
- To tackle this problem, it is necessary to collaborate with various teams, such as the people who can provide video data, the UI team, the website team, the mobile team, and the TV team, which can be a challenging and time-consuming process [(02:01:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7270s).
- Having a captain or a leader who can oversee the entire project and make decisions is essential, as it allows for faster progress and more efficient use of resources, even in a big company with many engineers working on a simple task [(02:01:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7296s).
- Giving engineers the freedom to work on a project and take risks can lead to better results and innovation, even if it means potentially making mistakes and facing legal consequences, as it allows for constant evolution and improvement of the product [(02:02:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7348s).
- The ability to take risks and make decisions also helps to identify and retain talented and mature employees who can work independently and lead teams to achieve common goals [(02:03:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7390s).
- Great engineers are not only skilled at coding, but also at explaining and convincing, and they thrive in lean teams that can move quickly, allowing them to create and innovate without being held back by bureaucratic processes [(02:03:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7411s).
- When great engineers are forced to wait for meetings and deal with slow decision-making processes, it can be detrimental to their motivation and productivity, causing them to leave the company or become disengaged and simply collect a paycheck [(02:03:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7428s).
- The challenge of managing and moderating user-uploaded content on platforms like [[YouTube]] is significant, as it creates numerous attack vectors and potential legal issues, such as copyright infringement and explicit content, which must be carefully considered and addressed by the engineering and legal teams [(02:04:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7470s).
- The legal side of managing user-uploaded content is complex and requires careful consideration, as companies can be held liable for copyright infringement or other issues, and must balance the need to protect users with the need to allow for free expression and creativity [(02:04:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7487s).
- The problem of users uploading explicit or inappropriate content, such as porn, into seemingly kid-friendly videos, is a significant and disturbing issue that companies like YouTube must work to prevent and address, and it is a challenging problem to solve [(02:05:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7511s).
- Companies like YouTube, [[Twitch (service) | Twitch]], and [[Netflix]] are working to address these challenges and create a safe and moderated environment for their users, while also allowing for creativity and free expression [(02:05:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7530s).

## ThePrimeagen origin story [(02:05:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7536s)
- The decision to leave Netflix and start a new journey as a streamer was made after considering the safety and fun of the current job, and the potential for growth and challenge in the new path [(02:05:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7536s).
- The streaming career started with a charity event called Extra Life, where the goal is to raise money for kids with cancer research, and the charity is notable for having no overhead costs and raising its own donations [(02:05:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7556s).
- The Extra Life event was organized by a friend, Guy Sereno, who is considered one of the greatest engineers, and the event involved playing [[Fortnite]] and streaming it to raise money [(02:06:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7587s).
- The streaming journey began in June 2018, and it started with playing Fortnite, getting affiliated, and taking subscriptions, and eventually, it led to enjoying the experience and deciding to continue [(02:06:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7610s).
- The transition from playing Fortnite to programming on the stream was a natural progression, as the streamer enjoyed using Vim and thought it might be interesting for the audience, and it started with a small but significant number of viewers [(02:07:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7629s).
- The streaming and programming routine involved balancing work, family time, and streaming, with a schedule that included reading to the kids, having dinner, and then streaming until late at night, three nights a week [(02:07:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7667s).
- The grind of streaming and creating content on [[YouTube]] eventually paid off, and it led to opportunities such as attending the streamer awards and announcing the programming category, which was a great experience [(02:08:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7684s).
- The decision to go full-time as a streamer was influenced by a challenge coin and a conversation with Pirate Software, which encouraged taking the leap and pursuing the streaming career [(02:08:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7696s).
- The process of leaving [[Netflix]] and starting a new journey as a full-time streamer was emotionally challenging, but it was also an opportunity for growth and exploration [(02:08:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7709s).
- The decision to leave a secure job and pursue a career in streaming was a difficult one, as it involves a lot of uncertainty and the risk of being hated by the public one day, but with the support of Netflix as a backing, the decision was made to take the leap and try something new [(02:08:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7727s).
- The realization that chances to do something unusual decrease with age led to the decision to join Netflix and eventually go full-time as a streamer in April, which has been a fun and inspiring experience, but also a hard and lonely one [(02:09:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7765s).
- The loneliness of being a streamer is a significant challenge, as it involves working alone with just a camera and an audience, and the ups and downs of that can be tough, but having a supportive editor like Flip has made a big difference [(02:10:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7805s).
- Flip, the editor, has been a crucial part of the team, having overcome a tough upbringing and rough life decisions, and has been working together for years, even when making zero dollars a month, and now gets to work together full-time [(02:10:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7821s).
- The lack of a team and the loneliness of being a streamer can be tough, as there is no one to share code or talk over code with, and no manager to report to, but the support of the audience and the freedom to explore and do new things on stream has made it a great experience [(02:11:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7861s).
- Combining the loneliness of being a streamer with intense attacks can be rough psychologically, but the love and support from the audience has made it worthwhile, and it's a journey that requires perseverance and dedication [(02:11:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7903s).
- Despite the challenges, the experience of being a streamer has been amazing and difficult, and has allowed for the exploration of new things and the connection with a supportive audience, which has made it a great and inspiring leap [(02:09:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7795s).
- The importance of learning from others and being exposed to different problem-solving approaches is highlighted, as it allows individuals to gain new tools and insights, and this is something that is missed when it's no longer possible to find mentors or learn from others in the same way [(02:12:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7930s).
- When interacting with others, especially those with less experience, it's helpful to approach them with an open mind and assume they may have valuable wisdom to share, which can lead to a more collaborative and productive interaction [(02:12:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=7945s).
- This approach involves assuming the other person is smarter and more knowledgeable, and taking their words as potential wisdom, which can help to mine for new ideas and insights [(02:13:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8011s).
- The origin story of the name "ThePrimeagen" is rooted in the video game Turok, specifically [[Turok 2: Seeds of Evil | Turok 2]], which was a brutally hard game that required players to navigate challenging levels and puzzles without dying [(02:14:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8084s).
- The Turok video game series, which features dinosaurs, action, and sci-fi elements, has evolved significantly since its inception in 1997, with notable games including Turok: Seed of Evil, which was released in 1998 and featured larger levels, more challenging puzzles, and deadlier enemies [(02:14:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8091s).
- The individual spent a significant amount of time playing a game on their Nintendo 64, playing for 10 hours a day for a month straight, and beating it was an incredible experience [(02:15:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8141s).
- The last leader of the game, Tro 2, is called the primogen, which inspired the individual's online name, "ThePrimeagen", a name they found cool as a kid in fifth grade [(02:16:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8160s).
- As an adult, the individual became disillusioned with the tech world, finding it pretentious and unfun, with a culture of "dick measuring" and exclusivity, which led to them changing their [[Twitter]] handle back to their video game name [(02:16:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8190s).
- The individual's goal in streaming tech was to destroy the existing tech mentality, which they felt was elitist and exclusionary, and create a space where people could be creative, excited, and build something without fear of being judged [(02:17:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8246s).
- They believe that everyone should be able to ask questions and learn without being expected to be smart, and that it's okay to be "dumb" and reinvent the wheel in order to learn and have fun [(02:17:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8266s).
- The individual draws inspiration from [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who overcame criticism of his name and appearance to become successful, and feels a similar sense of affinity with their own name, which has become a symbol of their counterculture movement [(02:18:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8286s).
- The name "ThePrimeagen" has become a recognizable and memorable part of their identity, and they would never change it, as it represents their "rage against the machine" moment and their desire to challenge the status quo [(02:18:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8324s).
- The importance of being creative and having fun is emphasized, and it is suggested that people should not be afraid to express themselves and enjoy life [(02:19:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8348s).
- The origin story of the mustache is shared, which began with No Shave November, a tradition where people do not shave for the entire month, and after it ended, the mustache was kept as a fun and natural thing to do [(02:19:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8369s).
- The mustache became a part of daily life and was even adopted as a lifestyle decision, with others reacting positively to it and referring to it as "mustache time" [(02:19:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8399s).
- The decision to keep the mustache was not universally accepted, with the wife being initially unthrilled about the decision to have a mustache long-term, but ultimately allowing it as a sacrifice for the relationship [(02:20:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8420s).
- The mustache is seen as a part of the personality and energy, and it is suggested that it was always there, but only became visible later on, becoming an integral part of the identity [(02:20:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8434s).
- The concept of sacrifice in a successful relationship is discussed, with the wife's willingness to allow the mustache being seen as an example of this, highlighting the importance of compromise and understanding in relationships [(02:20:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8443s).

## Learning programming languages [(02:20:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8452s)
- The approach to learning a new programming language involves starting by building something, putting hands on the keyboard, and figuring out how to do basic functions, which is a great way to learn through repetition and rote learning [(02:21:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8494s).
- This approach can lead to falling into traps, such as relying on previous experience and not understanding what makes the new language special, resulting in not being able to use it effectively [(02:22:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8531s).
- An alternative approach is to start by reading the language reference manual from top to bottom, which can take a long time, but allows for internalizing each concept and understanding the language's features [(02:22:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8561s).
- Reading the language reference manual, such as the one for Zigg, can be an effective way to learn, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the language's features and allows for indexing in the brain [(02:22:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8570s).
- Ultimately, the right way to learn a programming language is to build something, as it is necessary to put hands on the keyboard and discover what makes the language great or painful [(02:23:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8593s).
- The language reference manual is a detailed document that describes every feature of the language, and reading it requires internalizing each concept, which can be a time-consuming process [(02:23:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8615s).
- The goal of reading the language reference manual is to build a background model of the language, similar to AI terms, which allows for a deep understanding of the language's features and capabilities [(02:23:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8631s).
- The process of learning to program involves building up design choices, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different features, and then starting to build, rather than just reading and then immediately starting to build, because the specifics of how to do things, such as a for loop, are likely to be forgotten [(02:23:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8638s).
- For junior developers, a hands-on approach to learning is recommended, starting with extremely simple things and gradually increasing complexity, as this allows for a better understanding of fundamental concepts such as classes, methods, and instances [(02:24:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8666s).
- The use of AI as a learning tool can be beneficial, especially for those with prior experience, as it can help generate code and provide explanations, allowing learners to understand what the code is doing by experimenting with different parts [(02:24:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8696s).
- However, there is a concern that relying on AI and other tools can lead to a lack of memorization and understanding of fundamental concepts, resulting in a kind of "learned helplessness" where individuals rely on quick fixes rather than taking the time to learn and understand the underlying principles [(02:26:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8801s).
- This trend of valuing speed over knowledge can lead to a generation of programmers who are incompetent in certain areas, as they may not have a solid foundation in the basics of programming, having instead relied on tools and AI to get by [(02:27:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8829s).
- The unique, bespoke, or complex aspects of programming can be difficult for juniors to learn, potentially causing a gap in their development and preventing them from growing as programmers [(02:27:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8833s).
- AI has the potential to both help and hinder the learning process, as it can provide answers and guidance, but also prevent individuals from learning fundamental concepts if they rely too heavily on it [(02:27:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8856s).
- The ability to recognize when AI-generated code is correct or incorrect requires experience and skill, which can be developed by building projects from scratch and learning to identify when a new solution is needed [(02:28:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8901s).
- Using AI to generate code can be a useful learning tool, especially for beginners, as it allows them to experiment and modify existing code to understand the syntax and behavior of a programming language [(02:28:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8926s).
- However, it is also important for programmers to write code from scratch in order to develop their skills and close the gap between reading and writing code, as reading and understanding code is not the same as being able to write it [(02:29:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8955s).
- There is a significant skill gap between being able to read and understand code, and being able to write it, as writing code requires a deeper understanding of the language, its syntax, and its nuances [(02:29:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8988s).

## Best programming languages in 2025 [(02:29:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8995s)
- The discussion revolves around the best programming language to learn, with the suggestion to consider the top five languages, and the [[Stack Overflow]] developer survey is referenced to provide an overview of popular technologies, including JavaScript, [[HTML]], [[Python (programming language) | Python]], and [[SQL]] [(02:29:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=8996s).
- The potential bias of the Stack Overflow survey is questioned, as it may be influenced by the types of users who participate, such as new developers and those who frequently answer questions, which could result in a biased set of data [(02:30:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9035s).
- The most popular technologies listed in the survey include JavaScript, HTML, Python, SQL, [[TypeScript]], Bash, [[Java (programming language) | Java]], C#, and [[C++]], with some surprises, such as assembly being more popular than Ruby, which seems unusual since few people write assembly by hand [(02:31:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9101s).
- The idea of a single "best" language is deemed too broad, and it's suggested that the choice of language should be based on the specific goals or areas of interest, such as game development, backend work, or embedded systems, with languages like C, C++, JavaScript, and Go being suitable for different applications [(02:32:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9145s).
- For those looking to get into programming, it's recommended to first determine what they want to achieve, whether it's for a job or out of curiosity, and then choose a language that aligns with their goals, with considerations for factors like language speed and limitations [(02:33:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9191s).
- JavaScript is considered a beautiful language that is great for beginners to learn, as it allows users to express anything with very little effort and provides a visual representation of their work, making it an ideal language for introducing people to programming [(02:33:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9204s)
- The language has a wide range of applications, including frontend and backend web development, game development, and even embedded systems, with examples such as programming a [[Roomba]] with JavaScript and React [(02:34:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9275s)
- JavaScript's versatility allows users to start with simple tasks, such as drawing and moving a box, and then progress to more complex tasks, like writing a quick backend, saving data to a database, and animating it on a screen or canvas in 2D or 3D [(02:33:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9232s)
- Despite its potential, JavaScript is often subject to criticism and memes that portray it as a language to be hated, but it has many great features that make it an excellent choice for newcomers to programming [(02:33:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9221s)
- As users become more familiar with programming, they will need to learn more about the subject and explore other areas, but JavaScript provides a solid foundation for introducing people to the world of programming and its many possibilities [(02:34:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9264s)

## Python [(02:34:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9290s)
- [[Python (programming language) | Python]] is a leading language for applications related to data or machine learning, making it a great choice for such tasks [(02:34:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9291s).
- The combination of Python, [[CUDA]], and [[C++]] would be highly effective, as many Python libraries rely on C++ underneath the hood [(02:35:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9300s).
- Python is a great language to work with, allowing users to get quite far, but it is not suitable for writing front-end code [(02:35:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9312s).
- For individuals who prefer front-end design and development, JavaScript is a more suitable option, although Python is still a good choice due to its capabilities in machine learning [(02:35:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9323s).
- Machine learning tasks can be performed more easily in Python compared to JavaScript [(02:35:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9325s).

## HTML & CSS [(02:35:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9330s)
- [[HTML]] and [[CSS]] can be considered a Turing complete language when used together, meaning they can solve any computational problem, but for practical purposes, HTML is not considered a programming language [(02:35:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9330s).
- The definition of a programming language can be determined by the Turing test, which is a good measure, but for non-academic purposes, the ability to write functions, if statements, and loops is a more practical definition of a programming language [(02:35:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9345s).
- HTML is more of a specification than a programming language, as it is used to specify the structure and appearance of web pages, including features such as accessibility, layout, and transformations, rather than performing complex computations [(02:36:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9362s).
- Despite its limitations, modern HTML has a lot of features, allowing for complex web page designs and interactions, but it still lacks the fundamental programming concepts of functions, if statements, and loops [(02:36:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9365s).
- The distinction between HTML and programming languages is important, as it affects how developers approach web development and the tools they use to create interactive web pages [(02:36:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9371s).

## Bash [(02:36:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9380s)
- Bash is considered one of those programming languages where people may question whether someone really likes it, and it is noted that nobody likes Bash, although some people use it a lot [(02:36:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9387s).
- The command line is a aspect of Bash that is liked, and being comfortable with it can be seen as a bit of a superpower [(02:36:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9398s).
- Learning Bash and being comfortable in the command line is good, as it can be a useful skill to have [(02:36:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9409s).
- Bash has limitations, such as issues with arrays, which can be a drawback when using it as a programming language [(02:36:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9393s).
- Despite its limitations, Bash is still used by some people, and it is considered good to learn and be comfortable with it [(02:36:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9413s).

## FFmpeg [(02:37:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9420s)
- [[FFmpeg]] is a powerful library system that has numerous parameters and options, making it a complex but rewarding tool to master, with its capabilities growing exponentially as one becomes more familiar with it [(02:37:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9420s).
- The people behind FFmpeg are considered brilliant masterminds, as they have to work with various codecs, containers, and compression algorithms, making them experts in the field of media codecs [(02:37:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9462s).
- FFmpeg is a crucial component in many applications, including [[OBS Studio | OBS]], and is often used underneath the hood, but it does not receive the recognition it deserves [(02:38:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9507s).
- [[SQL]] is considered a sophisticated programming language, with features such as case statements, functions, and stored procedures, making it a powerful tool for managing data [(02:38:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9529s).
- The top programming languages, including JavaScript, [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[Python (programming language) | Python]], and SQL, are not strictly statically typed languages, and learning a language like Go, [[Rust (programming language) | Rust]], or [[C++]] can be beneficial for understanding types and changing one's perspective [(02:39:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9550s).
- When it comes to recommending the top five languages to learn, it's suggested to explore a dynamic language like Python or JavaScript, as well as a strict language like Rust or Go, to gain a well-rounded understanding of programming concepts [(02:39:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9591s).
- Exploring a "loosey goosey" language like Python, JavaScript, or Lua can be beneficial, as they have a single type that can be used in various ways, and can help developers understand the differences between dynamic and strict languages [(02:40:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9605s).
- Learning a language like C++ can also be useful, as it allows for type erasure and can be used to understand the underlying mechanics of programming [(02:40:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9629s).
- New C++ is considered a great language with every feature one could want, including smart pointers and no memory leaks, making it a desirable choice for programming [(02:40:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9641s).
- There are several languages that are of interest to learn, including Swift, [[Elixir (programming language) | Elixir]], [[OCaml]], and Odin, with Elixir and OCaml being functional languages that are lacking in the current skill set [(02:41:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9666s).
- [[Lisp (programming language) | Lisp]] is also a language of interest, but the community and modern usage are important factors to consider when choosing a language to learn [(02:41:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9690s).
- Posting accomplishments on [[Twitter]] can be a good way to get feedback and excitement from the community, with languages like Elixir having a small but excited community [(02:41:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9712s).
- Programming is already a niche topic, and functional programming is an even smaller topic, making it difficult to get feedback and attention on social media [(02:42:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9729s).
- Editors like [[Emacs]] and Neovim have their own communities and followers, with some people preferring one over the other for various reasons [(02:42:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9739s).
- Exploring new languages, referred to as "side honeys," can be a fun and interesting way to learn and discover new programming languages, with Go being a favorite for building web apps [(02:42:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9775s).
- Languages like Jai and Zigg are being explored for their power and interesting features, but they also have "foot guns" and can be challenging to use [(02:43:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9802s).

## Performance [(02:43:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9822s)
- The performance of programming languages, including [[Zig (programming language) | Zig]], C, and [[C++]], was compared, with Zig initially coming out on top in Dave Plamer's testing of close to 100 languages for speed, but this was attributed to variations in how the languages expressed the task rather than actual performance differences [(02:43:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9823s).
- The language ball test on [[Twitter]] showed Zig ranking sixth or seventh, and by adding the "no alias" argument to the function, the code could be optimized to be faster than the C version, demonstrating that the initial results were not entirely accurate [(02:44:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9851s).
- The competition between Zig, [[Rust (programming language) | Rust]], and C++ is interesting, with each language having its strengths, such as speed, ease of writing performant code, and safety features [(02:44:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9881s).
- C is considered the ultimate language, capable of doing anything, but it is also difficult to learn and use, while Rust is an ultra-safe language that prevents certain expressions, making it a safe choice [(02:44:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9895s).
- Zig is seen as a middle ground between C and Rust, offering optionals, which prevent null pointer dereferencing and segmentation faults, and allowing for both safe and unsafe code to be written, making it easy to write and pretty in concept, even if the language itself is bland [(02:45:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9923s).
- The idea behind Zig is to provide a balance between safety and the ability to express both safe and unsafe code, making it an interesting choice for programmers who want the benefits of both worlds [(02:46:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9961s).

## Rust [(02:46:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9975s)
- The strengths of [[Rust (programming language) | Rust]] include its ability to free memory directly tied to the stack, which simplifies memory management and prevents common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing and memory leaks [(02:46:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=9990s).
- Rust's memory management is not based on a garbage collector, but rather on a system that automatically cleans up memory when a stack variable goes out of scope, making it easier to manage memory without the need for manual memory deallocation [(02:47:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10020s).
- Another key feature of Rust is that mutability of variables must be explicitly specified, making code more readable and understandable, as variables that are not marked as mutable cannot be changed [(02:47:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10063s).
- Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency, and it enforces memory safety without using a garbage collector, instead utilizing a borrow checker that tracks object lifetimes at compile time [(02:48:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10101s).
- Meta programming is also discussed, with a preference for [[C++]] but acknowledging that it can be a mess, especially when it comes to debugging, and an interest in exploring the capabilities of meta programming in languages like [[Zig (programming language) | Zig]] [(02:48:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10127s).
- Zig is noted for its meta programming capabilities, which are integrated into the language itself, allowing for more straightforward and flexible meta programming without the need for a separate macro syntax [(02:49:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10154s).
- The concept of prime numbers at compile time in Zeg is an interesting and unique thing, where code executes at compile time and the result can be taken advantage of at runtime [(02:49:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10176s).
- The language to be used this year will be Go, with the goal of exploring and building out a service that can communicate with Chad and 11 Labs, and work with websockets to see how it performs in this realm [(02:49:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10197s).
- The ability to read [[Twitch (service) | Twitch]] chat has been implemented, which required using Berkeley sockets, an old way of doing it that involves creating a connection, reading from the socket, and parsing out IRC messages from scratch [(02:50:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10223s).
- Implementing Berkeley sockets involved creating a connection, specifying the [[IPv4]] family and [[Transmission Control Protocol | TCP]], looking up the address with DNS, and connecting to it with TCP, which is a more manual and raw process [(02:50:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10247s).
- The process of working with Berkeley sockets is fun, despite being more manual and requiring a lot of work, such as creating a socket, reading from it, and parsing out messages [(02:50:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10259s).

## Epic projects [(02:51:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10263s)
- A favorite project involved taking a Doom ASI port, which allowed playing Doom in a terminal, and sending it to the browser so people could play it online, with the added feature of Twitch chat controlling the game by piping in chat inputs and averaging movements over time [(02:51:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10277s).
- The project used various encoding techniques, such as quad trees, run-length encoding, and custom compression algorithms, to reduce the data size from gigabytes to kilobytes, making it possible to send the game state to thousands of people at the same time [(02:51:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10317s).
- The game control pipeline worked by having people in [[Twitch (service) | Twitch]] chat input commands, such as "W" to move forward, which would be held down for 150 milliseconds if the majority of people inputted the same command during that time period [(02:53:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10389s).
- The input from Twitch chat was obtained using IRC, a [[Transmission Control Protocol | TCP]] socket, which had relatively low lag, but still caused some difficulties with timing and player control [(02:53:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10437s).
- The project resulted in a fun and interactive experience, with around 1,000 to 4,000 people participating and successfully completing level one of Doom, including killing zombies and blowing up a barrel [(02:53:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10424s).
- The favorite project involved encoding, which required thinking about compression, and was inspired by [[FFmpeg]], a company that has to think about compression a lot [(02:54:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10458s).
- The chat community in streaming is a significant part of the experience, with different platforms having distinct characteristics, such as Twitch having a cultural, human-centric community with shared memes and emotes [(02:55:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10523s).
- YouTube's chat community is considered technically the worst, not because of the platform itself, but because users often come to learn and are not part of the same cultural zeitgeist as Twitch, with discussions focusing on specific topics rather than shared memes [(02:55:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10511s).
- [[Twitter]] has a similar cultural phenomenon to [[Twitch (service) | Twitch]], with a set of jokes and memes, but the community is much smaller, with typically only 50 people participating, compared to 1,500 to 3,000 on Twitch and 800 to 2,000 on [[YouTube]] [(02:56:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10573s).
- The difference in community engagement between platforms is significant, with YouTube users often focused on learning and not participating in the same level of cultural exchange as Twitch or Twitter [(02:56:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10591s).
- The ability to create a culture on chat and ride the "meme train" is important, and YouTube's chat functionality can make it difficult to achieve this, with features like timestamp changes allowing users to jump into conversations at different points [(02:57:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10620s).
- The community on X and Twitch feels contiguous, with a shared cultural zeitgeist, whereas YouTube's community feels out of sync [(02:57:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10635s).
- YouTube chat is considered the best chat due to its openness and accessibility to the world, making it easier to share and more established than other platforms, allowing it to be sent to people who don't usually watch video game streaming [(02:58:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10695s).
- The term "swim" originates from [[Netflix]], referring to the act of scrolling through a feed, and is not a widely recognized term, with only a few people at Netflix using it [(02:57:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10668s).
- [[Twitch (service) | Twitch]] has a strong sense of community, but its platform is often associated with video games, which can be a turn-off for those who don't participate in the Twitch sphere, making it less accessible to a broader audience [(02:59:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10767s).
- The X platform has a lot of growing up to do in terms of features, and its success will depend on changing user expectations and adapting to a new style of interaction, with its audio-first approach being a great first step [(03:00:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10827s).
- The technological platform and interface of X, [[Reddit]], and [[Facebook]] shape the discourse in different ways, with X having a unique style that is incredibly dynamic and vibrant, even if it's not always positive [(03:01:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10863s).
- Joe Rogan's podcast discussed the relevance of Twitch, with Jamie stating that it's still a growing platform, highlighting the divide between those who participate in the Twitch sphere and those who don't [(02:59:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10778s).
- [[YouTube]] is not really a community, as every single video has its own mini community, and there's no cross-talk that happens in multiple videos, but community is awesome and provides a feeling of connection, [(03:01:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10889s)
- The concept of community is also present on YouTube, particularly in live streaming, where the same folks show up and interact with each other, creating a fun and celebratory atmosphere, [(03:02:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10926s)
- As a programmer, there isn't a single project that has shaped the individual, but rather a specific spot in the development process where they learn the most, typically around 5 to 10,000 lines of code, [(03:02:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10974s)
- At this point in the project, the choices made earlier either weigh the programmer down or free them up, and it's where they get to test their initial gut decisions about software design and think about how to scale the project, [(03:03:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=10983s)
- The ideal project size for learning is around 5,000 lines of code, where the programmer can evaluate their decisions and learn from their experiences, and this number should increase as they gain more experience, [(03:03:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11020s)
- Large projects, such as those with a million lines of code, are not necessarily holistic, as different parts of the codebase may have been written at different times and in different styles, [(03:03:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11029s)
- The goal is to be able to work on larger projects, such as 20,000 lines of code, without being overwhelmed, and to be able to make good decisions about software design and testing, [(03:04:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11064s)
- The topic of enjoyment is being discussed as a starting point, with the idea of just enjoying something being mentioned [(03:04:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11066s)

## Asserts [(03:04:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11067s)
- The joy of programming comes from creating powerful systems that work correctly, and one of the ways to achieve this is by using asserts to debug and test the system, which can bring a sense of joy and fulfillment when the system works as expected [(03:04:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11069s).
- The use of asserts allows programmers to see the payoff of their work and quickly debug a system as it grows larger, discovering errors before they become real bugs and solving them efficiently [(03:05:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11107s).
- A system with thousands of lines of code, such as 10,000 lines of code in [[Python (programming language) | Python]], can be considered a point where the magic of programming happens, and the use of asserts can help ensure that the system works correctly [(03:06:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11164s).
- The idea of putting asserts everywhere to effectively crash the program when it encounters an unexpected state was discussed with [[John Carmack]], and it is an old technique that can be useful in programming [(03:06:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11173s).
- The use of deterministic simulation testing, as employed by Yuron, the CEO and creator of [[Tiger beetle | Tiger Beetle]], involves using asserts in every function to guarantee the creation of great software, and this approach can be applied to programming [(03:06:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11213s).
- The use of asserts in every function, both in production and testing, can help identify where things go wrong and provide valuable insights into the system's behavior, as demonstrated by Yuron's approach [(03:07:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11249s).
- Building a reverse proxy for game development and adding asserts to the code helped identify and fix numerous bugs that would have been difficult to find otherwise, making the programming experience more enjoyable [(03:08:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11286s).
- Developing a skill set for programming over time involves not only specifying preconditions but also anticipating and accounting for unexpected issues, which can be achieved by adding asserts to complicated functions and classes [(03:08:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11314s).
- Jonathan Blow's approach to starting a project without knowing the implementation details and wanting a programming language that makes it easy to quickly figure things out was mentioned, highlighting the importance of building and learning as you go [(03:09:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11350s).
- Programming often involves building and solving puzzles while not knowing what the next step will be, requiring the ability to anticipate and prepare for potential issues, which can be done by using asserts and treating warnings as errors [(03:10:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11409s).
- Having strict asserts and treating warnings as errors can lead to more robust and resilient code, making programming more enjoyable and reducing the pain of debugging, especially in large code bases [(03:10:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11451s).
- Working with large code bases, such as those with millions of lines of code, can be particularly challenging when it comes to finding and fixing bugs, making it essential to develop good programming habits and strategies for managing complexity [(03:11:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11517s).
- Debugging can be a challenging and time-consuming process, with multiple days sometimes spent trying to figure out the root cause of a bug, not just the fix, which is a hard task [(03:12:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11520s).
- Using asserts is a fascinating way to approach a problem, as it involves intentionally crashing a system to identify and solve issues, and it is a skill that requires constant practice to develop muscle memory [(03:12:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11528s).
- Crashing a system can be beneficial in production, as it creates an incentive to ensure that the issue never happens again, and it allows for logging and measuring the frequency of errors [(03:12:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11565s).
- Instead of trying to minimize the visibility of crashes to users, it is better to stop everything and provide a clear message, such as "things have gone very wrong, we're unable to recover," to inform users of the issue [(03:13:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11589s).
- This approach may not be suitable for all types of projects, such as web projects, where crashing a server can have significant consequences, but it may be more applicable to single systems like robots [(03:13:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11615s).
- The process of debugging and using asserts can help developers identify and solve problems, and it is an important skill to develop, especially when working on complex systems [(03:13:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11617s).

## ADHD [(03:13:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11621s)
- Maturity is considered a key factor in overcoming ADHD, as it allows individuals to develop the resilience and emotional stability needed to stay focused and productive, despite the challenges posed by the condition [(03:14:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11649s).
- Emotional resilience is also crucial in managing ADHD, as it enables individuals to cope with the difficulties and frustrations that come with the condition, and to develop strategies to work around their weaknesses [(03:15:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11701s).
- Programming has been a helpful outlet for managing ADHD, as it provides a sense of focus and allows individuals to immerse themselves in a activity that they enjoy, with the ability to work on it for extended periods of time [(03:15:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11731s).
- Having a supportive partner can also play a significant role in helping individuals with ADHD to manage their condition, by providing help and support with tasks and responsibilities that may be challenging for them to handle on their own [(03:16:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11773s).
- Recognizing one's strengths and weaknesses is important in managing ADHD, and being aware of the areas where additional support is needed can help individuals to develop strategies to work around their limitations [(03:15:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11727s).
- Developing strategies to stay focused and productive, such as re-reading material or using audiobooks, can be helpful for individuals with ADHD, and can improve over time with practice and patience [(03:16:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11812s).
- Forcing oneself to pay attention and really listen to or read something, even when there are distractions, is a skill that can be developed over time with practice, such as re-reading a page or re-listening to an audiobook if the mind wanders [(03:17:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11825s).
- This skill is especially important when consuming media like audiobooks, which can be easy to tune out of, particularly when doing other activities like running, and it requires a conscious effort to focus on every single word [(03:17:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11840s).
- Developing this skill takes a lot of time and practice, and it may be painful at first, but it can become more natural over time, allowing for greater control over one's attention and ability to stay focused [(03:18:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11891s).
- Making a decision to change one's behavior, such as committing to read a certain number of pages without getting distracted, can be a mature and non-emotional decision that can be made at any time, and it's a decision that can be repeated and built upon [(03:18:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11907s).
- Using social media can be a challenging skill to master, as it's easy to get caught up in doom scrolling and mindless browsing, but finding a balance and being able to use these platforms in a healthy way is important [(03:18:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11937s).
- Excessive social media use can have negative effects, such as increased anxiety, and it's possible to notice a difference in one's mental state after spending time scrolling through social media, with feelings of anxiety and unease being common [(03:19:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11974s).
- The feeling of anxiety and unease caused by social media use is distinct from other emotions, such as anger, and it can be overwhelming, but recognizing the negative effects of social media use is an important step in developing healthier habits [(03:19:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=11986s).
- The experience of consuming media through social media is different from experiencing the same thing in real life, and it's possible to feel a sense of disconnection and emptiness when interacting with media through a screen, rather than directly experiencing the world [(03:20:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12011s).
- The mixture of chaos and anxiety inside one's head can be overwhelming, with the constant struggle between focus and distraction, and finding calm and deliberate focus is a valuable skill [(03:20:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12022s).
- Meditation is likely a useful practice for achieving this focus, as it allows individuals to silence out everything else and remove distractions, observing their breath and existing in the present moment [(03:20:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12039s).
- The concept of liberty is often misunderstood, as it is not just the freedom to do whatever one wants, but rather the freedom to do what one wills, and to have control over one's energy and actions [(03:21:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12067s).
- This freedom is hindered by distractions and the tendency to get trapped in convincing oneself to do something in the moment, rather than doing what one truly wants to do [(03:21:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12081s).
- Having control over one's energy and being able to do what one wants without distraction is a valuable skill, especially in the technological age where distractions are plentiful [(03:21:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12090s).
- Everyone struggles with this to some extent, regardless of their individual circumstances, and it is not necessarily determined by the "deck of cards" they have been handed in life [(03:21:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12101s).

## Productivity [(03:21:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12109s)
- Achieving focus in programming is a difficult intellectual endeavor that requires a process to approach problems and maintain real focus, and it is something that can be developed over time with practice and experience [(03:21:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12110s).
- When first starting to program, every part of the process can be a challenge, with many questions and side quests that can be exhausting, but as one learns their instrument very well, they become more able to focus on the thing they want to do [(03:22:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12137s).
- Learning to type and knowing one's editor very well can help to reduce mental processing power spent on looking at the keyboard, allowing for more focus on the problem at hand [(03:23:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12210s).
- Memorizing certain things, such as where keys are on the keyboard, can help to increase speed and reduce distractions, and it is possible to learn to stop looking down at the keyboard with practice [(03:23:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12226s).
- Having a rule to limit editing of one's configuration files, such as only editing once a year, can help to avoid getting sidetracked by trying to solve every problem or make the editor perfect [(03:24:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12298s).
- It is possible to spend a lot of time editing and customizing one's system, but at some point, it is necessary to stop and be fine with not being perfect, and to focus on the task at hand [(03:25:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12340s).
- Setting a goal, such as getting a computer from zero to 60 in a short amount of time, can help to focus efforts and make progress, and it is possible to achieve a high level of customization and setup with a significant amount of time and effort [(03:25:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12353s).

## Programming setup [(03:26:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12373s)
- The perfect programming setup includes a keyboard, operating system, and screens, with the keyboard being the most important aspect, and the Kinesis Advantage keyboard is highly recommended due to its concavity and thumb clusters that reduce wrist strain [(03:26:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12374s).
- The Kinesis keyboard makes it easier to press the backspace key, which is often associated with correcting mistakes, and this ease of use makes correcting mistakes a more pleasant experience [(03:26:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12382s).
- The backspace key on a standard keyboard can be physically painful to press, especially when making frequent mistakes, and the Kinesis keyboard alleviates this issue [(03:26:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12401s).
- Using a single monitor is also preferred, as it allows for a more streamlined workflow and reduces distractions, with the option to use a second screen for specific tasks such as streaming [(03:28:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12486s).
- The setup is designed to be navigated using a "press one key" mentality, where a single key press can switch between different applications, such as [[Twitch (service) | Twitch]] chat, browser, or programming environment [(03:28:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12513s).
- This setup is inspired by Starcraft and uses keyboard shortcuts, such as alt + number, to quickly switch between different applications and terminals [(03:28:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12519s).
- The use of a single terminal with multiple tabs, such as T-Mox, allows for easy switching between different projects and terminals, with the first tab always being the Vim editor [(03:29:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12553s).
- A long-running process terminal is used, with a setup that automatically spawns sessions for Vim, spare terminal, and other tasks, allowing for quick access to projects and optimized workflow [(03:29:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12576s).
- A plugin called [[Harpoon]] was developed for Vim, which enables pinning files to temporary buffers, allowing for quick access to frequently used files with a single keystroke [(03:30:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12608s).
- The workflow is designed to minimize search fatigue and reduce the need for manual searching, instead using keyboard shortcuts to navigate between files and projects [(03:31:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12667s).
- The number of windows or tasks being switched between is typically small, usually around three to four files, and the workflow is optimized to reflect this [(03:31:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12701s).
- The use of multiple monitors, including two vertical ones, can be beneficial for certain types of content, but it is also possible to work effectively with a single monitor, even with a limited number of lines of code visible at a time [(03:32:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12736s).
- The goal of the workflow is to minimize distractions and reduce the need for manual searching, allowing for a more efficient and streamlined work process [(03:31:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12686s).
- The discussion revolves around the effectiveness of using multiple monitors and keyboard shortcuts to increase productivity, with the idea that having more information visible at once can be beneficial, but may also come with a cost, such as the need for an extra monitor [(03:32:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12772s).
- Using keyboard shortcuts to navigate and automate tasks can greatly improve speed and efficiency, especially when working with code or other types of text, and can be achieved with tools like [[AutoHotkey]] on Windows [(03:34:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12857s).
- The importance of being able to see a lot of information at once, such as when reading articles or documentation, is highlighted, but it is also noted that this may not be beneficial for everyone, especially those who can only focus on a small area at a time [(03:35:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12900s).
- The use of Neovim, a modern take on the old school editor Vim, is mentioned as a preferred choice due to its superior navigation capabilities, known as Vim Motions, which allow for efficient spatial navigation using keyboard shortcuts [(03:35:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12959s).
- The idea of training the brain to navigate spatially using keys is discussed, and it is noted that this can be beneficial for productivity, especially when working with code or other types of text, and can be achieved with practice and the use of tools like Neovim [(03:35:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12946s).
- The comfort and ease of use of having large text and being able to relax the eyes while reading or programming is also mentioned, with the idea that this can be beneficial for productivity and focus [(03:35:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12932s).
- Vim has a language to describe movements in text, which is a well-thought-through set of movements for manipulating or editing text, including deleting, yanking, pasting, and copying, and is optimized for working with code [(03:36:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=12984s).
