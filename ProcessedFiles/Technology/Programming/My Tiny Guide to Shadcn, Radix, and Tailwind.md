- The frontend of the web has undergone significant advancements, with the introduction of new technologies such as [[React (software) | React]], [[Tailwind CSS]], [[Shadcn UI]], and [[Radix UI]], which have improved the way developers design and build web pages.
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design web pages with custom styles using a minimal amount of code, providing full control over styles, although it has a bit of a learning curve.
- Radix UI is a library of pre-built reusable components that serves a different purpose than Tailwind CSS, providing components that can be directly used in an application, with built-in accessibility features, and can be installed using the command npm install @radix-ui/themes.
- Shadcn UI provides reusable components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, offering high customizability, and unlike Radix UI, it does not require installation as a dependency, allowing developers to fetch and configure only the needed components.
- Both Radix UI and Shadcn UI can be used with frameworks that support React, such as [[Next.js]], [[Astro (South Korean band) | Astro]], [[Remix (web framework) | Remix]], and [[Gatsby (software) | Gatsby]], making them versatile options for frontend development.
- To get started with Shadcn UI, developers can use the command npx shadcn-latest to initialize the setup, and then add particular components as needed, such as buttons or alert dialogs, making it a flexible and efficient solution for building web applications.
