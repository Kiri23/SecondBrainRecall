- The [[SOLID | SOLID principles]], made popular by software engineer [[Robert C. Martin]], are five software development principles that aim to make software easier to scale and maintain, and they include the [[Single-responsibility principle | Single Responsibility Principle]], the [[Openâ€“closed principle | Open-Closed Principle]], the [[Liskov substitution principle | Liskov Substitution Principle]], the [[Interface segregation principle | Interface Segregation Principle]], and the [[Dependency inversion principle | Dependency Inversion Principle]].
- The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have a single responsibility, and if a class has many responsibilities, it increases the possibility of bugs, with the goal of separating behaviors so that if bugs arise, they won't affect other unrelated behaviors.
- The Open-Closed Principle states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification, with the goal of extending a class's behavior without changing the existing behavior of that class, thereby avoiding bugs wherever the class is being used.
- The Liskov Substitution Principle states that if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program, with the goal of enforcing consistency so that the parent class or its child class can be used in the same way without any errors.
- The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use, with the goal of splitting a set of actions into smaller sets so that a class executes only the set of actions it requires.
- The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on the abstraction, and abstractions should not depend on details, with the goal of reducing the dependency of a high-level class on the low-level class by introducing an interface, making the code easy to adjust, extend, and test with little to no problems.
