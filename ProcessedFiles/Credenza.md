- The Credenza component is a responsive UI element that switches between a Dialog and a Drawer based on the screen size.
- It uses the useMediaQuery hook to determine whether the screen size is desktop (min-width: 768px) or not.
- The Credenza component has several sub-components, including CredenzaTrigger, CredenzaClose, CredenzaContent, CredenzaDescription, CredenzaHeader, CredenzaTitle, CredenzaBody, and CredenzaFooter, which are also responsive and switch between their Dialog and Drawer counterparts.
