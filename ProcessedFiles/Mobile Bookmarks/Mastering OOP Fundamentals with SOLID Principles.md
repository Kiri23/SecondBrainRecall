- [[Object-oriented programming | Object-Oriented Programming]] (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software around objects, allowing for modular and reusable components.
- The four core fundamentals of OOP are [[Encapsulation (computer programming) | encapsulation]], [[Abstraction (computer science) | abstraction]], [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming) | inheritance]], and [[Polymorphism (computer science) | polymorphism]].
- [[SOLID]] principles are used in addition to OOP fundamentals to ensure good code quality and avoid poorly structured object-oriented code.
