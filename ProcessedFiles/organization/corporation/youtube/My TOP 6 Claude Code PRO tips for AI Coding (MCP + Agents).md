## Introduction to CLA Code and Context Priming
- The goal of using CLA Code Pro is to achieve asymmetric engineering in the generative AI age by building systems that can build systems, with the advantage of reusing created value over and over [(00:00:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=42s).
- CLA Code enables engineers to accelerate their engineering in the [[Generative artificial intelligence | Gen AI]] age, and the CLA Code team is constantly shipping new releases and techniques to help engineers work more efficiently [(00:00:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=56s).
- One technique for using CLA Code more efficiently is context priming, which involves providing the AI agent with context about the code base it is working on, allowing it to understand the essential files and structure of the code [(00:01:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=80s).
- Context priming can be done by adding a prompt to the [[README | readme]] file, which can then be copied and pasted into CLA Code, allowing it to read the essential files and understand the code base [(00:01:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=106s).

## New Features and Techniques in CLA Code
- The CLA Code Engineers have implemented new features, including parallel reads with a sub-agent call tool, which adds items to CLA Code's context window at application startup, providing a summary and context for the [[AI agent]] [(00:02:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=127s).
- Setting up the AI coding assistant with context priming allows it to win right away, and downloading the essential elements of the code base can speed up work and provide a general structure of the code base [(00:02:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=165s).
- Using techniques like running "get LS files" and "tree" can help provide context and structure for the AI agent, and operating in a single file agent's code base can be beneficial for building powerful single file agents [(00:03:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=194s).
- The importance of context in AI coding is emphasized, as feeding CLA Code and AI coding tools the context they need is crucial for getting the job done, and engineers should always think from the perspective of their AI agents [(00:03:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=228s).
- The winning engineers in the [[Generative artificial intelligence | Gen AI]] age will be those who can think from the perspective of their AI agents and provide them with the context they need to succeed [(00:04:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=249s).

## Tools and MCP Servers for Cloud Code
- Having the right tools and MCP servers is crucial for [[Cloud computing | Cloud]] code instances to succeed, and these tools can be categorized into collectors and executors, with collectors gathering contacts and executors performing CRUD operations, such as updating files and databases [(00:04:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=257s).
- There are two primary tools for collection: the out-of-the-box fetch tool from Anthropics servers and Fir Crawl, a simple tool for scraping and crawling single websites, extracting key information, and traversing multiple pages [(00:04:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=293s).
- A new file editing agent is available, which uses Sonet 3.7 and enables editing files using a brand new text editor tool, allowing for precise file editing and is a great example of an executor tool [(00:05:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=327s).

## New File Editing Agent and Token-Efficient Tool
- The new file editing agent can read and write files, and an example is shown where it summarizes a [[README]] file into a new README summary file, demonstrating its capabilities [(00:05:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=357s).
- Anthropics has also shipped a new token-efficient tool, which can be used with the beta flag, and this tool is important for building effective agents, especially when dealing with file editing tasks [(00:07:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=423s).
- The importance of having tools embedded in [[Cloud computing | Cloud]] code is highlighted, and an example is shown where the fetch tool is used to combine and fetch data from multiple pages, demonstrating the power of collectors and executors [(00:07:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=450s).

## Cloud Code's Parallel Run Subtask and File Editing
- The Cloud code's new parallel run subtask is demonstrated, which allows for running tasks in parallel, such as running the fetch tool on multiple pages at the same time [(00:08:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=489s).
- The process involves creating a new file, which will be a markdown document with content collected automatically, and this new document has both the tool use docks and the efficient tool use combined [(00:08:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=507s).
- The context for the new file is collected, and then a follow-up AI coding prompt is written to update the existing single file agent file editor with the new Sonic 3.7 file editing tool, which will use the Let Me Go a and collaps everything [(00:08:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=533s).
- The file reference hotkey is used to paste the content, and then the update via a D-efficiency flag is initiated, which will kick off the process of updating the file without needing to reread it because it is already in the context window [(00:09:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=555s).
- The code is generated with the D-efficiency flag, and it includes three endpoints with the efficiency token flag, thinking tokens, and Max compute loops, but there is a premature close error due to the anthropic APIs being hammered [(00:09:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=596s).
- The change is successful, and [[Cloud computing | Cloud]] code summarizes everything that got changed, including the brand new message args beta flag, and this is where tip three and four are introduced, which involve having Cloud code review and execute the code [(00:10:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=627s).

## Tips for Using Cloud Code: Release Notes and Thinking Mode
- Tip three involves using the release notes by typing slash release, which shows the release notes and allows users to keep track of everything they are releasing [(00:10:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=653s).
- Tip four involves using the thinking mode by saying ask [[Claude (language model) | Claud]] to make a plan with thinking mode, which taps into Cloud's Hybrid Base reasoning model capabilities, and users can also use think, think harder, or Ultra think to tap into these capabilities [(00:11:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=672s).
- The brand new efficiency flag is set up by pulling in the context using an MCP server, and the prompt is updated to create a flask API with three endpoints inside of agent workspace, which will run in efficiency mode with thinking tokens [(00:11:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=692s).

## Efficiency Flag and Token Usage Comparison
- The goal is to create two versions of the API, one running without efficiency and one with efficiency, to see the difference [(00:11:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=715s).
- The process involves handing off work to [[Cloud computing | Cloud]] code and AI coding tools, specifically using a command to test token efficiency, and then combining it with a think mode to get auto-completions from the cursor and Tab [(00:12:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=727s).
- The command is pasted into Cloud code, and the agent is run to track results in both efficiency mode and without efficiency mode, with the goal of comparing token usage [(00:12:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=758s).
- An issue with thinking tokens is identified, with too many tokens being passed in, so the number of thinking tokens is dropped to the minimum of 1,024 [(00:12:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=778s).
- The agent is run without the efficiency beta flag, and then with the efficiency flag, to compare total token usage and identify any potential errors [(00:13:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=790s).
- [[Claude (language model) | Claude]], the AI coding assistant, automatically makes corrections when needed, such as updating older syntax, to ensure the code runs smoothly [(00:13:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=820s).
- The efficiency token flag is used to save tokens for the agents, with Cloud code providing an analysis of the token usage and savings, resulting in a 5.7% reduction in token usage [(00:14:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=891s).
- The biggest savings are seen in the output tokens, which are priced at $15 per million, making it important to save on output tokens to reduce costs [(00:15:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=915s).

## Context and Cloud Code Updates
- The context is crucial in AI coding, and paying attention to what the AI coding assistant can see within its context window is essential for effective coding [(00:15:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=929s).
- [[Cloud computing | The cloud]] code engineers are working on new features, and the release notes can be accessed using the slash release command, which provides information on what the engineers are currently developing [(00:15:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=936s).
- The updated agent now includes a new efficiency flag that enables token efficiency, which can save around 5-6% of tokens, and this can be activated by adding a new cool beta flag [(00:15:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=950s).

## MCP Servers and Built-in Prompts
- Tip number five involves using the slash command to quickly activate one of the built-in prompts, and the model context protocol (MCP) servers have predefined prompts that can be used to pass in specific variables [(00:16:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=973s).
- The MCP servers allow users to tap into different prompts, which can be powerful, and an example of this is the fetch prompt that can be used to set up cloud code [(00:17:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1075s).
- The MCP servers can be added quickly using a [[JSON]] format, and this can be done by copying a JSON string from the release notes and pasting it into a new file [(00:18:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1122s).
- The JSON format can be used to reinstall MCP servers, such as the fetch server, and this can be done by opening a new file, pasting the JSON string, and setting the JSON for the server [(00:19:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1141s).
- To add a new MCP server in CLA Code, users can copy and paste the command, clean it up, and then use the content inside the actual object, which is valid JSON, to define the server [(00:19:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1149s).
- The JSON approach is a faster way to add MCP servers, but users can also use the step-by-step wizard provided by CLA Code to walk through the process [(00:20:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1226s).

## Agentic Coding and the Future of Engineering
- CLA Code is a breakthrough tool that allows new capabilities for agented coding, especially when combined with MCP, enabling AI coding assistants to run not just programming tasks but also tools that collect and execute across various domains [(00:21:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1296s).
- The tool is paving the way for the next phase of engineering, which is agentic coding, and it is essential for engineers to take advantage of these tools to build systems that build systems for them [(00:22:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1320s).
- Agents can help multiply productivity and scale up what engineers can do, and CLA Code itself is an agent for engineering, the terminal, and other areas, with a focus on building out agents for various use cases [(00:22:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1342s).
- Understanding agent design and agent architecture at a fundamental level is crucial, and the channel will focus on this topic to help engineers scale their impact and consume more compute to work on their behalf [(00:22:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1359s).
- The surface of what can be done with agents is a unique advantage that should not be underestimated, and it is time to start gathering a suite of tools for both collection and execution to scale up what can be done with incredible AI coding tools like CLA code [(00:22:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1374s).

## MCP Servers and Tooling
- There are several MCP servers that can be used, and the choice of server may depend on the tools and tooling used to engineer, such as [[PostgreSQL | Postgress]] or [[Docker (software) | Docker]], with various tools available for each [(00:23:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1392s).
- The tools used can include Postgress, Docker, and other docker tools, and it is helpful to know what tools others are using and what their favorite tools are [(00:23:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1406s).

## Building Systems and Community Engagement
- The key to success is to focus on building systems that help build systems, staying focused, and keeping building to achieve the desired outcomes [(00:23:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQ_i9XdkXU&t=1418s).
